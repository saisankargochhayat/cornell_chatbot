Forget it.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
In 9th.  For a month
You did what?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
So did you
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Because she'll scare them away.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Never
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Okay!  I wasn't sure
No, I ' m not.
And why would I do that?
What?
We don't chat.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
He always look so
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Funny, you're the only one
I know, just let me sleep
Busy
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Unwelcome.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
What?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
No -- impressed.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
We're your guys.
Your daughters went to the prom.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Are we going to argue?
I am busy inside.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
That's what it says.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Give me absolution.
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You will regret this.
Come over here.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Where are we going?
What about Oleg?
Give me another one, please.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
So you were never a prostitute?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Daphne, I...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Okay.  But not water sports.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
A timer.
It's okay.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
What are you saying?
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Just a shower?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
There are two bodies found at this point.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Alright.
You're not so bad yourself.
Answer it.
You promise?
Okay.
Jesus Christ.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Dog food.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Tommy, take a walk.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks.
Yes.  Both.
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
What are you doing here?
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
I'm here for movies.
I used an accelerant.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Don't blow your nose!
The clerk?
It's possible.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
No. I never did, either.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
But not completely inconceivable?
I guess it isn't.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Goodbye, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Goodbye.
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I'll think about it.
No way to start a partnership.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Thank you.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
He's after your money.
Not likely, convict.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Why?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hi, it's me...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
We got a lot to talk about.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Five.  On credit.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
That's what I'm saying.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Who?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Leeloo..
He's on vacation.
Oh god!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Okay, I believe you.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Don't...
Bullshit.
Dino...
Is it?
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
What's the problem?
Look, I don't know what this...
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Move it, dirtbag... !
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Fuck you!
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
What did you do with her body?
Show me where you buried her.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
I'm asking.
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
What about me?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
No.
Do you think the police did a good job?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
What?
I don't want to.
We have matching luggage.
What?
I know.  Uh...Alice.
"In her dream"?
Kristen's story really got to her.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Huh?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I've got to go.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
My baby!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Under <u>water</u>?
What direction does the system indicate?
Minus three.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Yeah. I know about that.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Double A. New Britain.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
In the chest.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
What then?
Yes.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
I still don't understand --
Okay. She's fine.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
Said what?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
But not now.
What way?
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Good.
Think they're alright?
How?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
Something about my father?
In the living room.
You and me.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Who?
Well, it was an accident.
Then who shot him?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Not particularly.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
That's not really the point.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
This doesn't make sense.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Where are we now?
Stand by.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
A dubious distinction, no?
What do you want with us?
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
What's the story?
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
You better take this.
Te...!
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
So mentally ill?
I think so.
Yes, sir.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Yeah.
I don't want to hear that word!
You're sure?
He's carrying a bomb.
What should I say?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
No.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
The gear is down.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Yes...
He didn't recognize me.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Was.  Divorced.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Ss-ai!
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
But there's no more drug.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
See you soon.
Well, thanks, I --
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Dead on all channels.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
...We're coming in.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
Stand back.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
You're just reading me.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
You're really something, ace.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Wah...?  Where are...?
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Newt, wait!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Yes.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
What?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Why not?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Yes!
Tell them to go!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Your father is dead.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
But! I'm a married woman!
What?
Why you?
I was at hand.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Do you hear him? Do you?
Behold!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Ah-ha!
Yes?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
What do you mean, Sire?
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
I don't know. He has pains.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Animals?
German!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
You burned the score?
With all my heart, Mozart.
But what is it they don't like?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Who?
What time?
Yes.
Yes.
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Yes.
Exactly. A dance.
On the contrary.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
And do they believe it?
I poisoned his life.
Yes.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
What do you mean - now?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Is David acting strangely?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
What?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
Good.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
I thought not.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
David.
Right.
She's a jerk.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Yeah?
Pecos Bill.
No, but he was on the moors.
Come on, where?
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Life mocks me even in death.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Thank you.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
You here again? What do you want?
Yeah - sure!
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
How much?
And tell him not to delay.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
What do you mean, help?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Why, of course.
That don't do us any good.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
What is?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Well, what?
Don't you know?
Why, Cyril, you're insane
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
I haven't any.
Well, I
You're protecting somebody.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
If he can do it, yes.
Did you get the case for the securities?
What'll we do?
Absolutely.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Well, he was making love to her.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
What time did you get in?
I'm okay, Matt.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Never a good thing.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Then I love it.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
You're not scared, are you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Yeah.
Let's ride.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Shit.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
That would have made an impression.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
You're doing just fine.
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Don't care.
The posters?
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Yeah, Jimmy?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Boys?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Where will you find such a girl?
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Let me see that.
Damn.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
By burning down their homes?
And it is my pleasure to be here.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
I remember you.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
In English, Pinkerton.
What is that?
Pumpkin?
I know. Stop it.
You like it there, don't you?
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Yes?
It's not that nice.
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I won't...don't worry.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Uh huh.
Jesus lives, Luis.
What?
New card. What do you think?
You look nice today.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Who?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Interesting.
Forget it.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Okay. Do.
Uh huh?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Coffee?
It's no problem
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
You sure?
No problem. 
Well...
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Where did Paul hang out?
Hmmm.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Not really.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Marcus?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Yes, Owen?
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Prick.
He wasn't acting?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Is it your dish?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Skywire.
You've been coming in early.
The wrong place?
'Sorry about the late notice...
Let's go.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
Where we going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Who can we trust?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
That's lame, isn't it?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
You may.
Care for some saki?
Hungry.
Good luck, Austin.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, and Austin...
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Thanks.
Hey, Mick!
That does not compute.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
He's too well-protected right now.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Indeed.
Oh, behave!
Are you crazy?
I'll secure the perimeter.
I love you, Austin.
Hey, wait a minute--
Shut up.
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
There are limits?
Black...
... death ...
Peter ...
This isn't a game.
To you ... ?
So am I.
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
What are my choices?
I'll never marry you.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I didn't. Mother did.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Nothing personal.
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's called Black Leather.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
I fail to see --
So you say ...
Dead, I'm afraid.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Where?
Walk over to the window ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
But did they teach you this?
...Really?
You're kidding.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Hey, man, congratulations!
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The car for Debbie?
Shit!
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
But how can I do that?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Gonna get married...
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Great, Mom.
I think I screwed that one once.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Why?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
What do you mean, it changes?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
I'd love that.
Feel free.
Oh, no!
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
My gift to you.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I don't know.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Right... Think it over.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
He's alive.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Yeah... too bright...
Roll the hose.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
You're back.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Leave Stephen out of this --
-- I work for the city.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
You could check. It'd be in his files.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Sure you do.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
The outlets.
Trychticholorate.
-- Another backdraft.
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
What reason?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
How ya feeling?
Just wondering.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Like it never happened...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
I have a job.
What the hell are we waiting for?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
I treated you better.
You can't keep being his father...
What's wrong?
And old ladies?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
You don't know... nobody knows...
I might.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
Yes.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
That 50 G could help you --
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Well you did.
I'm a revolutionary.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We was coming to see you.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
You're now Mantan.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Who are the other characters?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I want to speak with you.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
What point is that?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
I can't go all the way down south.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Soon.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
The best defense is offense.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
To come back to our roots.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
We should go out on a double date.
Around...
...too early...
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Enough.
My people love me.
You look beautiful like that.
You leave something out?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
I know I won't be your puppet.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Your cousins go out with him.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Who else can give me information about you?
That is a trifle strong.
Never.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
It is my only object.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
But you refused me, Dorothy.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
As much as possible?
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Papa?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Is he all right, papa?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Dark Valdez.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
What do we do?
HEY!
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
He's lying.
Yeah --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Jesus!
Do what?
Yeah.
You're the only one missing a grenade.
That's exactly what he says about you.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Just look. Little pocket.
You're lying --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
But not the only victim, right?
Well?
I didn't do anything --
I don't know --
And the problem is you only got three.
Who killed Pike?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
What are you talking about?
That's preposterous --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You and the Colonel go back.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Watch me.
But you will.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Isn't this how your story goes?
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
Tough.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Really.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Think it'll work?
But you didn't see it, right?
We've been making progress, I see.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Thank you.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
Go.
No, I understand.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Stop.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
What's your name, Giant?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Oh, so you know.
How what happens?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm robbing this place.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
Did you?
That's because most of it never happened.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
I need you on my side.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I paid for those guitar cases.
That's not a burn.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Uh... Yes.
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What are you doing here?
Right.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Oh nothing.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
What's wrong?
I don't want to know.
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
I don't want to talk about him.
He will come back.
Sometimes.
So now you hate all women?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You...
You don't understand you either.
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's alive?
Except for Small Eyes.
Whatever.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
I do. God's truth. I do.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Yeah.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
You sayin' you'll do what?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Come on, gal...
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I CAN'T!
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
I can handle that.
You drink whiskey?
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
You can handle it.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Huh?
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
I told you to TURN BACK!
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
What's that chain around her for?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
This all looks wonderful.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae...
Rae!
Yeah, I know.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Yeah, I do.
You need money again?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
The Wolf?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
I didn't know.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
Let's grab some food.
I hope not.
What does Charlie mean?
If you give me one.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
I can see that.
I stole them.
Nick...
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Let's go.  Him first.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
She's such a long way home for you.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Look.
You had my help, detective.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I'll pay you.
Anywhere.
Then go get him.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
What's the problem?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
Thank you.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
She's not with you?
Go.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Okay, but...
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Four years.
I'm doing okay.
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Me too.
Do you recognize any of them?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Why should I be?
I'd kill it.
Ugh.
I've already got more help than I need.
What do you want me to do?
Yeah.
Like?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What's up?
No.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
I'm tired of this.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
My office.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
What?!
Eve? I'm leaving.
You're lost?
Do you own a car?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
I guess we'll need another locker.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Bites what?
It does?
Sure.
Never drive again!
Thank-Q!
That's boring!
Not that one!
I like her.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
What?
Well, you had better!!
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Then why go there?
Merci!
...the pipe tobacco.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
That's what everybody believes?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I don't think so.
Goodbye.
Hi.
Really? No kidding?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
No.
Yes.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Coming!
And I made these!
I thought ten years.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
Eve?!
Uh..he might of.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Where did he get all that information?
We came back to the house!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Um...uh...
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
You're all through with this now?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
THEN WHAT?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
Yes, I like you.
No.
No.
No. I should go.
Please, please stay.
Are you a bad boy?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No.  Hi baby.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Bull.
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Then, shut up!
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
On a ride.
Good, let's drink up.
What?
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Where are they?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah.
What did you see?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
That's what I thought.
Okay, okay.
See ya tomorrow.
You want to go talk to him?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Yes mother.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Look under the body.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Where's your gun?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Right.
Shut it. It's Ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
For what?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Can she I.D. them?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Where's my cat?
The Sicilians.
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Who were the victims?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
You believe?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
I'm lookout.
Yeah.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Bob?
True.
No. We didn't.
Sure.
Right here.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
Would of been nice.
We need a car.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
That's what she is!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Let me feel that.
Get out of the way.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Eleven fifteen.
Yeah. As a girl.
I'll see you there.
I'm not kidding.
The grandfather clock?
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Yeah.
Yeah. He said that.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Yes. I did.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
That's my responsibility.
God DAMMIT.
He electrocuted someone?
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Yeah. It is.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Take him to the car, Bob.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Now!
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
We're just going over a few things.
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
Where?
Is that your chiquita?
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Fight. You know.
It's locked.
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
I want to know what happened.
May I finish?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Don't you want answers?
Look at me.
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I'm sorry.
He's dead.
I did.
I worry when you get like this.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- hang on --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
My first job.
I was here!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Who's this?
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Are we locked up?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Fourteen? --
I rest.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
I will not.
We don't split up!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I am trying.
I must... consult with my father.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
How soon?...
So what did you find.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Okay.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Cute, Evan.
So you believe me?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
And...?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Been there, done that.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I'm sorry.
He did. Captain Renault did.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Monsieur.
You want my advice?
Well?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Goodnight.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I'm awfully sorry.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Yes, something.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Uh huh.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
And I said I would never leave you.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
I will, don't worry.
He suggested I ask you.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Your work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
How about New York?
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Huh!
Our entertainment is enough.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Why two?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Excuse me.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
What is your nationality?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
-- You thought what?
I don't want them here overnight.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Just a little something of my own.
No, I don't.
Worse than Warsaw.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
Then we've just got shit.
As much as anybody.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
I've got lots of time.
You don't seem too happy about it.
For when I travel?
You did?
Yes there is.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I would have done the same thing.
You too.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Not to mention on me.
Sure.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
That's why you're a gambling man.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Well, we have to help her!
Mr. Rose *knows*?
"...did." Well, okay.
Yes, I *have*!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Really! Is it serious?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Right?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
I haven't read that.
I don't think so.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
That's it.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
I don't follow.
Everything looks in order.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
And these cops? What do they get?
She walked.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Jake, I mean, come on --
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
We're not cops.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Just play a part. A little acting.
You're just going to have to trust me.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Don't ruin this for me.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Your mess.
We're getting a little old for running.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Then who's the Banker?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
To who?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
What are you talking about?
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
How's that football story corning along?
I've got a job.
Tension. It'll go.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Marion, stop this.
I hate public transport.
How can anyone be that naive?
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
First visit to London?
Your father?
Toss you for it.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I owe a lot of money.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
I have to take the car.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
I've still got mine.
You've done pretty well.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Rough life, Jack.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I make it six.
Good call.
Does he win?
Oh. What's wrong now?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Time to start talking.
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
And I saw that I was alone.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Exactly.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Any of 'em any good?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Not now!
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Talk to the bomb.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
None of your business.
Where?
She was there...
No time.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll make it worth your while.
What else can we do?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Thank God.
Girlfriend?
Bent?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
We are not fine.
Yes on all counts.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Well, not me personally.
Look, thank you for this but--
And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
A friend of your fiance's.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You did.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
How's this about me?
I'm on my way.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
You know what I'm saying.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Okay, okay, okay--
More like deployed in bed asleep.
He's sick.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Got any KISS?
Thanks.
Oh, screw it!
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
What? That's disgusting!
You got in the car, didn't you?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Curly.
The paint!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're what?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Neither do I!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Yeah.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I didn't say shit.
Our saviour...
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Sure.
Well...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should we care?
I think he saved my life.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Do you feel alone right now?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I have the power to build a time machine.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Soon. Time is almost up.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
Gerald.
It is a big deal.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
No more fuckin' for her.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
I just did.
Here, have some.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Wisconsin.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
That's enough!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Uh, Gladys?
Harold!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear President"...
You do and I'll fire you.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
What do you whistle?
Did you shoot the rapids?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Go ahead.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
But -
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And here are my mother and father.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Yes?
Never mind that, I want my man!
Good morning, sir.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes.
Hello...
Say "Merrick".
Mmmerrick.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Of course! What did you think?
How is your tea, John?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Here.
Good morning.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
It's your fantasy...
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
Goodbye, Aud...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
What d'you mean?
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Really.
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Ah.
Why should you care?
I don't know! I just did!
That's my boy!
Make your mind up.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Just say something cheerful.
We'd be the first!
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
What d'you expect me to do?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
So did my father and his father before him.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Dad!
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Oh. So...
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I'm Joel.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Sort of, um...
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
No, I'm okay for now.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
You'll call me, right?
I don't think we're ready.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
Well, you're married.
You had the whole human race pegged.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Yeah, like that.
What do we do?
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Joel, come here. Please.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I don't know.
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Hi.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Well... I did.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No. I just need some space, maybe.
In a minute.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
I know. Anyway --
It's a good one all right.
Where?
I swear.
Well, thank you, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
You can if you want.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Easy come, easy go.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
What is Debbie's position?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
On my way.
Coffee.
You're okay now, it's over...
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
I built it.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Thanks.
That is not acceptable --
Negative.
I don't know.
Do it.
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Dr. Weir...!
Love to.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
Not according to the computer.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
The forward airlock.
It means nothing.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Baby, you're scaring me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Reed?... Sue?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
No: You're ON FIRE!
But all these people...
Now.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Susan. What are you doing?
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
First door on your left!
Manager!!
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
What? Are you all right?
We've got to get an abortion?
No.
I would. Yeah.
Really?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Just be glad you're all right.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't do that.
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
There's nothing to it.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
I want romance.
Sometime?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
If you graduate.
All right! Oh, yeah!
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Not down in my parts.
And nobody did anything?
Naw! Not a major.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Lacerda?
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
That's a strange attitude.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
We can't risk letting them in.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Yeah.
With what just happened upstairs --
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Follow me.
Get in line!
The door... on three.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Anybody else?
Oh.
Oh, no.
Will I go crazy or something?
But --
The girl's got rhythm.
Huh?
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What?
Oh? And what's that?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
You keep that key handy.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
That's one piece of four problems.
Right.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
What did we say about lying?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Excuse me, sir?
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
An actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Occupation?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you an actor?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Yeah, well --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
You don't know what you want.
Yeah.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Oh no...
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Forget it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Whattaya think you're in now?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Yes, Ma.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
What's wrong?
Not long.
I'll be back.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.
Oh bullshit.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Stay calm, please.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Yeah?
Kill me and have done with it.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
And you look so lovely.
I should go. I should leave today.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
I give you my soul...
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I've no choice
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
It wouldn't dare.
No. But someday.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Yes? And?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Ah. An explorer.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I finished the boats.
Marcie?
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I can't, Barry...
Oh, you...
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I don't love Neddy.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Mmmmmmmph.
Those things can be nasty.
How much do I owe you?
That's thirty percent.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
So do I just follow you?
I have no idea.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Come again?
My wife.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Yes.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
No, I didn't.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
What are you going to do?
Where are you taking us?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
I'm really sorry.
Not many.
Me too.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Gotcha!
No.
Feels good.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
-- This conversation is over.
What'd ya see?
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Or what?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I did?
What?
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Pardon?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
West?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Chances of recovery?
Just like you would be.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I saw an article...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'd sure like to know who.
And how do you know that?
Thanks, Wick.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Your new roommate.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
We are so fucked.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
What?
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
It's good to see you, Nick.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
You'd be surprised.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Not now. You got my bag?
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
I don't think so.
Me too.
Follow me.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
You're standing on it.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
What are you suggesting?
But you don't know for sure!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
Thanks.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why do you need that?
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Is that the bathroom?
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Right... Sorry, sir.
I'm... I'm shot.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Excuse me guys.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
What does the Omega 13 do?
How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Lt. Madison, GO.
It's fractured...
... What does that mean?
Right.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Don't be ridiculous.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We.. We lie.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
You... You mean Earth?
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
It's as far as it goes!
What kind of signal?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
Practice driving, Tommy.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Because they're coming right at us.
What does she see in them?
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
The army can survive without me.
That can't be.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Yes, general?
No.  I guess.
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
No, my lord.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
Lafayette will not be happy...
Then use rocks!
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
No one knows...
But it's more than just that, am I right?
You invented this, this...
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Uh... none just now, but...
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I rode here, on my horse.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Yes!
Who says so?
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You're right.
Not too bad.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
What about her?
Tell you what...
She can't talk right now.
I'm working on a few things.
Leo, I don't know.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
I don't like waiting.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Where you been, Harry?
I want you to.
But you work for the casino?
Maybe a few times I have.
Harry, look at me.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Let's see how we get along.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Twenty seven hundred.
We talk different?
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
What's that?
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
They report it to the IRS.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
How'd you know I was here?
"Cotton".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
You thought I was faking?
He already knew it.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
How honorable of you.
Hello, Martin.
And after all, you have such morals.
A passenger liner. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
That's what it says.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
What?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
A what?
Get up.
Threw a turbine blade.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
She take a radio?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
It looks like it.
How about you Epps?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Not me.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Conveniently enough for you.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Better than starving to death.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You sure it wasn't me?
Only something must've gone wrong.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
We hit land.
What?
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
Let the buyer beware.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Yeah.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Not the Maxine?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What are you trying to say?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
...wow...
So what do you think?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Help me what?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
When did I say I hated you?
How long have you been up?
Are you ready to go?
Good.
Hey, look at this...
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
What are you talking about -- who?
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
"Hassle"?
Why don't you ask him.
Everybody's too stupid!
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Wait...
You cunt!
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Well, we won't keep you.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
It's kind of falling apart.
That tape sucked, by the way!
Did you bring that tape?
What?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Sure, I guess.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Well are --
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
It's not hopeless...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
For nineteen years...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Are you okay?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Who knows?
How can you be so sure?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
...I better not...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
I'm just being realistic.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
They're Seymour's.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
No... they said she was here...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
As are they all.
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Yes he is.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me. 
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
That's what the books say... 
Actually, no.
That's very considerate.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
You give me hope, John. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Not even close.  What happened?
We don't have a relationship.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
Okay, that's no problem.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Oh, hello, Peter.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Hi, Egon.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
What are you doing up here?
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.

Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I knew that.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
Well don't think!
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Wonder what?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
I am Zuul.
Like a used car salesman.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Out!
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Thank you.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Yes, it would.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
What?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I agree.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
Who?
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I blame myself.
God, it's ugly!
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Who was the architect?
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And the seas would boil ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Not yet, dear brother...
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
I'm serious.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
I don't know...
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
But have never been?
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
We all know what right is, Senator.
They can't... if this is Rome...
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
So I understand.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Narcissus!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
I killed too many barbarians.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Before they leave, get gold.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
No.
No.
No -- why should I?
I just want to tell you something.
Is anything wrong?
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes.
With a family?
And it's all over now.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Oh.
Is it because I'm here?
How could you do that, Benjamin?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Then what?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
My belt.
No.
Will you kiss me!
I don't know.
You mean you're confused?
I'll think about it.
I just don't think it would...
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben.
Mr. McQuire.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What for?
Well here's the purse.
Give me an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
What?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Of course.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Please.
Why not?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What's wrong?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Let me out!
Thank you for taking me home.
Of course.
A hanger.
INADEQUATE!
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Oh my God.
Neither.
I don't remember.
Him?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
No.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I don't.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
Kind of.
What?
Then let's hear them.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Benjamin?
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Hey -- I don't get it.
Oh, no.
Not if you don't want to.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Different.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Swell. I appreciate it.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Thank you.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
HUH?
The pearls are in her room.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
No -- why? -- should I?
What?
Of course.
Chasing what?
Anything for you.
You live here?
And then --?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I'll go -- good-bye.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Nobody, Doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Stay where you are.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Oh, don't go.
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
With the same friend?
Can't you understand me?
Hello!
No -- now.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh!
Take them back, Suzette.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Certainly, sir.
I could not think of not accepting.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
My son was in the hospital --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
You know it, Lilly.
I like you, too.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
A future. The only future I've got.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
That's just Lilly's way.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Open it and find out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
What?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Bullshit!
) What?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
You up to it now?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Charming.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
No shit.
No.  Wait for the police.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
I'm not leaving without her.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I'm okay.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Shit happens.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Shit, Linda!
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Thanks!
Very insightful.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
We can light our own tree at home.
Guess so ...
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
God ... this can't be true.
Him.
Here.  Let me try.
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
He's gone.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
This is madness, Wynn.
Jamie's baby ...
No!!!
Um.
Oh, shit.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
So long, Colonel.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
In what way, pray tell?
I know you think that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Is Penelope in?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Man and boy.
They were in the same creative writing class.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
Where did you get the poison?
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Can I get dressed first?
Open the bolt!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Situation.
We all are.
Do say hello to your mother.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
It's so--so stark.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Yes.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Did you like it, dear?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
You've killed women?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I've got to run!
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
You've been bitten by bats?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
With spittle?
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
I'm utterly satisfied.
Don't shoot.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
I was afraid to ask.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
It's beautiful.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Father's friend.
It's fine!
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
I'm touched.
I see.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Meaning?
He's not your son.
We met here earlier this evening.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Man, how many girls do you need?
Overpowering?
You making a feature?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Is that the way it was with you?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
What do you care about?
I care about my daughter.
No, please go on.
Why can't I meet him now?
What makes you so sure?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
I can't tell you that.
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
In G.R.? Why?
What have you found out?
I don't know.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
It's just a name.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Sounds all right.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Was he with a girl?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Come again.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
What kind of a car is it?
Not very.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Well then.
Promise?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
What?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Well, I don't...
Yes.
You are the wisest person I know.
Well, don't go.
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I'm getting married.
Perhaps it is.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No.
I don't know.
No.
Yes.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
What kind of stuff?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Well, I didn't.
No. You look...
It certainly is.
If anyone can help, HE can.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
You were ALL human!
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
What is it?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Me?? C'mon --
Is it bad?
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Anung-un-Rama...
Each of us gets a belt.
No. Don't --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Do you really need this bed, lady?
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
Stay the fuck away from me.
This isn't happening.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
You want it?
Tell me who you are.
Ssh!
Hurting.
Not know.
Tell me, damn you.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
Sure.
I have to see my father.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
It's just been empty a while.
No. I'm not.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
I cut myself.
No, you're not.
What's wrong with you?
Come with me then.
What?
No personal details?
I won't be a moment.
What did you say?
YOU'D like my room.
Me like.
I want to see.
I thought we'd lost you.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
What happened to you?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Terrific.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Ooh.  Drag.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
No, you can't.
I have all of the others.
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Your desert island top-five.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Fine.  That's great.
Nice friend.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Do it.  Do it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
You look upset.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
I dunno.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I don't have your number.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Mmm hmm.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Who the fuck's Pig?
You're also an idiot.
C'mon.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Okay.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
But what?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I mean it.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
You called this morning?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
I'm sure it isn't.
Right.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Sure.
You're the expert.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
You're very macabre.
No.
I don't follow you.
Anything in Maryland is close.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Have you gone to the police?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You want me to front for you.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
I wish I could.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
A factor of age.
What about that family in '31?
Will I see you again?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
The inheritance.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
We've got nothing to say.
What are you getting at, Moran?
All I need is for you to check the name.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
What are you doing man?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
You are the same?
Not even a single lifetime.
No!
You will live.  Survive.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Muy Bien!
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But I did live.
Mulet.
It can be different.  It must be.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Yeah.
How many came?
He knows I'm here.  How?
How did you find me?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
You were never a kid.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Of sorts.
This isn't done.  Get up.
And if I refuse?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
You're a kind man to be sure.
We were very close.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Seventy-five.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
The five hundred? Sure.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
How?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Get out of here, you!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Done what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
I haven't any hard feelings.
You can break it, can't you?
Sweeney.
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Now you got me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Hold on a minute.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
All the words you've got.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Yes.
Who did you talk to?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Then why are you doing it?
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
You said it!
Me, too.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
I did.  Hold the wire.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
A sight for sore eyes!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
My name is Louis Peluso.
Come on with that money!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Mother!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Quiet, Mollie!
Never mind! Just play dead.
What's from the Governor?
Get the Governor on the phone!
The what?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Pinkus.
You can't bribe me!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Come on, fellas.
I give that marriage six months.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
She and Mollie were talking.
But Grandpa, you said...
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Who told you that?
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Could.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
I don't know?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
It looks....foreign.
That's it.
What are you going to be then?
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Yikes.
Where's that?
OK.
OK.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
What?
The Duke?
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah.
OK, Boss.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
What!
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
I don't want to see that.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Why?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Rise and shine.
Tell me about it.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
You got to be fucking joking.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Yep, I found something.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Who's your Daddy!
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Where we headed?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
What.
Right...  ...come on.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Gabrielle.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Oui, doctor, oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Hmmmph.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
No. You look so beautiful.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It's okay, Puff.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Okay. If you think it will help.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Three foot one.
Rose, please go away.
Nathan told my brother.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
No biggie.
Yes, and...
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
Nathan!
I'll be out in a minute.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
Why certainly!
That's a great idea.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
It's perfect!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Have you?
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Ooka.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Unn.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
No.
Mm hmm.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
How?
All I want's the money.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Character.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Whaddya been so far?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
For who?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Now, when did you adopt me?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
A son.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Now and then. Why, do you?
That's right. When?
What time?
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Yours.
Fair.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Do you always ask so many questions?
Give me a drag.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Raw.
No, why should I? It's yours.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Why did he tell you?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
A week? A year?
Oh, grow up.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Just for luck.
Shut up.
California. Oakland.
That's right.
I hear you've been looking for me.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
What?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
Virginia...?
That's the Air Force Base.
What did it look like?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Better now, son?
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
Where, Jimmy?
I don't see anything.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
You're being paranoid.
That's the good news?
What're you talking about?
I'm thinking.
Dad, don't start.
You still got the Olds?
Can't this thing go any faster?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You as well.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I hear you.
So push it!
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Many worlds...
All my life!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Do you believe, Marcus?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
The Grail Diary.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
So it did.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
So did I.
Try and burn through the ropes.
I'm out, Dad!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Relax.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
When?
After you, Junior.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
I don't need camels.
No camels!
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
And why were you trying to kill me?
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Lao She.
Nee chin lie how ma?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
THE WHAT?!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
No -- real food.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
What -- the bug?
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Willie!
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Figures...
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Me.
Yes.
What street?
Why don't we go home?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
You said it.
Yep.
Yeah.
Why not?
I'll tell you what to say.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Corridor A.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
I can't do that.
Just get there.
I don't want to eat it.
Without your pants.
Rene...
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
The beautiful one.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
What do I do?
You think. That's what you're good at.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Neither can they.
Well...?
While he makes the run.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
...Shit! It's just money.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Dieter!
And don't let her know, either.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
You have nothing...
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you remember...
Don't you want to get out?
Not you. Them.
Been hearing voices.
Sir?
Dinner...tonight.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
That depends...
You seemed interesting.
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
He didn't.
Get your things.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Can you?
Why?
Can't you do something?
What?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
That's twenty feet high.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
You can't take that.
It is?
What does he know?
For reading.
Sure. Where?
I'll be there.
Monday.
What? Forget it.
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Why? Who said?
I'm doing an interview.
Yeah.
I have to take a shower.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
No, you do not.
Who is this?
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Alright.
It would be better if he called us.
All right. See you...
Yeah.
What?
What?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Give me a break!
Everything interests me.
How have you liked your stay?
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Did work.
Fuck you, too!
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
...okay.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's okay.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I'll call them, Lowell.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What?!
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
What?
She's okay.
You called me.
There is -- there is no family.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Who do you want me to kill?
No...
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
We did not.
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
Thanks, buddy.
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
What do you mean, was.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
How do you know?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Have you tried the duck?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles? You're scaring me.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
What kind of "stuff?"
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Marylin?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
That's true.
Hello Miles.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Marylin.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client has ruled that out.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
And it's good!
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
And she has...?
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Come in. Sit down.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Please don't shout.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
No, I'll go through with it.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
But the lady says
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You must have me confused with
That's right. You didn't.
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Like what?
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Yes.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
You! Don't make me laugh.
We don't need forty cars.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come onget in.
Come on! come on! 
What about money?
I love you.
Same to you.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Not interested. 
Whatever you say, darling.
Why, he'll be back.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
What's that?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Yeah? Where?
Thanks.
Huh?
Don't accept any more.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
What?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Right.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
No, I'm not...
You, Numa?
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
No.
What?
That's our case!
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
How many men?
The Warren Commission call him?
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Yes.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
His name?
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
The assassination, Jack?
She's the best damn witness we have!
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
That's it.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
But then you told her you were home.
Yes, Max, I understand.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Sure.
What's in it?
Why does it need to be dark?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
I am. Have a seat.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
It's different with men.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
I see.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Why?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
What if I've figured a way?
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
I hesitated taking that much.
What's he doing?
Not after they're dead.
I know what it looks like.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
Not really.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
But you didn't do that.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Hi, Melanie.
And what was your answer?
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Talk to you tomorrow.
So we need two people, two women.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Uh-huh.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Designer clothes.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Sure.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
No thanks.
I thought you were sixteen.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
No.
Does that bother you?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Fuck you for asking me that.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.
Ten thousand sounds high.
I need your name and address.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Did the police contact you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Git your ass in here.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Turn left.
'Ola!
No problem.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
What isn't happening?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
It's all been a dream.
No, thanks.
I see.
Yeah, ever since that ...
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Well, try, huh.
They're not interested, Jake.
There was a bang.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
You need ... a doctor.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
A couple of weeks, I think.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Likewise.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
But I see them.
I'm not cold.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Go to sleep.
Thanks.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
I don't know.
Who? Jed?
They're weird names.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Lie down!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Am I home?
Why didn't you call me?
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I can do anything I want.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
What's gotten into you?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I'm not upset.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Where are they?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Like it was yesterday.
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Pleasant dreams.
Hot. Where do I sign?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
A long time.
Nothin' much.
I need to see you, Jake.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Punk?
Pause play.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
He....He...
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Thorgan? You coming?!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Hey, easy now.
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey!!
Well, do something!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
You lost the charge?
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Are there any other shuttles?
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I missed you too.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
I gotta go back.
But?!!
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
30? How long was I out?
I didn't say he was alive.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Exactly.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
You got it.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
I never hear the whistle.
I think they make you look sexy.
Do I need any more authority?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Why?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
You could say that.
No shark did that to a boat!
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
What's the matter with my printing?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
This is Quint, Missus.
He's busy.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Let me see your hands...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
I'm okay...
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
We could get back together too.
No...
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Can we make out now?
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
What are you talking about?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
I'm a junior.
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Viscera?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
You know... it's parts...
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Why?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
What?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh really?
Nothing...
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Elbow.
Wow! It's magical.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Right, seriously.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Yeah.
He whips you?
You can?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
I heard that.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
As many times as it takes.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
I don't know. Wish I did.
What do you need a Bible for?
No sir.
Best kind.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Forget it.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Dahlia, no.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
You wanna hear mine?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
I'm finished.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
No.
Wasn't my fault...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Could be.
Yes.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Let me smell it again.
To what? Virgins?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
You got any money?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah. She's only 13.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Yeah. Why you give money.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Right.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yeah.
Why?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I guess so.
One.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I know.
No, I didn't bleed.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
Nah.
It's very monotonous.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yeah.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
No.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Anything?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
It's a voice modulator.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Please... wait.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
You don't understand.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
I just can't believe it.
Why did he what?
Come here.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
Yeah.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
We're not sure.
Anything else?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
We'll call you back.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Getting too hot in here for you?
It wasn't intentional.
This isn't a game.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
I know it was bad.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
For emphasis?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Because she killed herself!!
Of course not.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
I'm sure you are.
About what?
You won't have to.
I will find her!
Yes.
Even by you?
I cannot betray my bride.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
That I promise you.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
You do?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Then he will die!
That I am, my lady.
The new King.
With an old voice?
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
She has the power of vision.
Her name is Death.
That is true.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
OK.
OK.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
I never rent my gear.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, stop, please!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
...No... he's my lover...
Why am I such an authority?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
Maybe later.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
You have?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
No.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
He's plastered.
That's okay -- really it is.
Where?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
That's me.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
It's yours.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Orange soda?
Water?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
You were going to get my door.
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Sera...
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
We?
Can we just ignore it?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
With an old friend.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
No.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
No. I was in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Just the love in my heart.
Aristotle.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Definitely! I love him!
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Licensed attorney or family member?
Delta. Gamma.
You know her?
What?
You think?
So?
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She's completely untrustworthy.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you sure?
What, like on va-kay?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
What?
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
You go to lady now?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am afraid of nothing.
Like some vile toadstool.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I see...
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Careful, lad.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Jack, don't!
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Will you chance a miss?
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Can you save her?
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
And I love you, my husband.
Pinching?  Where?
I can't see a thing.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
What became of the princess?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
And am I not fair?
That was in jest.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
The Black Baron, you say?
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
I thought I might stop by.
Oh.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
No.  That's okay.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
We're not gonna do anything.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
Forty.
Thank you.
Yes, it is.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
I want you both to stay.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I did warn you.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Mom...please.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
She seemed upset.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Oh.  Sorry.
I was parked in day parking.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Do you remember?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Please don't leave me.
Either do you.
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Nagger?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But you can't.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, boss.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Uh-huh.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
You lost all our money in a card game?
What ain't there?
Winston. His name's Winston.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
What do you want, Claude?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
You get ketchup?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Crawfords.
Crop duster.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
You ever done time before?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
It's just such a slap in the face.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Definitely.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
How bad?
That's what I'm thinkin'...
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Are you dead?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
We're ready.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Well then...?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
Maybe... sure...
And then you killed him, right?
That's tomorrow.
You're not going, are you?
He's good, isn't he?
They won't listen.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
I won't.
You know, Jessica.
One in a million, I suppose
To what?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Beloved wife...
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
What makes you think so?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
No, no, no
Alive?
I'm sorry.
Oh my... I'll try.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Too little.
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Okay.
You okay?... What's wrong?
What do you mean by that?
No. Fred hates them.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Right... This just glided along.
You know what I think?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Hi.
Okay.
No... no.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Yeah.
How'd it happen, Alice?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Where is he now?
What's the word on the street?
Who is it?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
Who was the man?
He won't give his name.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
At your house. Don't you remember?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
No, nothing.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
All right.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Which would you choose?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Pornos?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
What?
What?
Sure.
I don't know.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Well, what do you know about that!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Yes.
They were in a quandary, and
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
It's unbelievable.
Gold. You were going to
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
When are you going to start?
Oh, yes.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
Shall we have another?
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Thank you.
How can we get in touch with them?
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants  and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me go, Bob!
Why - I'm sorry - but I
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
What about the others?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
Bump?
I was just going to.
Why, mother?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
I gotta be honest about something.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
It was a long time ago.-
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
A what?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
We're rising.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Why not?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Are you sure you don't?
Nothing.
They're not my pals--
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
The what?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Is it now?
Can you see the balloon man?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
I have to go back.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Who wanted her little girl back?
RUN!
I know... I do, too...
Whatever you say, John.
Oh, yes.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
You mind if I tag along?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
That's right.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I wanted to.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
If... you have one.
-- and then walk out.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
He's my subordinate!
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Two?
We can stop him.
How many?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
We used to, every summer.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
What if I gave you forty?
Thank you, sir.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
She's, uh, sleeping.
No.
I love you. Come home.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
No coke tonight.  Right?
I want you to quit.
I want you to take her with you.
But what about them?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Yeah. Where is he?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Brooklyn.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
That's it.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
So, that's it. I'm out?
What is it?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Soho.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
I'll beat your ass --
Is that the woman from..?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
I told you what they said.
How'd they know who you were?
I mean, that's what I heard --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You got that right.
Fine.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Eighty.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go now and wait.
You're not getting a gun.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Yeah. I want it.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
It means you got a gun?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
No. What is it?
But, Max --
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Bet you are.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
What you say?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Don't con me.
What the hell for, man?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Read it and keep on reading.
Then the devil is white.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Next week, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
It will be rough.
Talk about what?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
We need you too!
I don't think that's such a good idea.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
I assumed...
What color were the original Hebrews?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
I mean it's late, baby.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[Who killed her? You?]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Correct!]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Yes or no?
I'm a bargain.
That's right.
I'm not crying.
How do you think he got out?
Where?
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
I don't understand.
Don't worry. You will.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Frank. Frankie.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
I'm fine.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
What was her name?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[A beautiful circle.]
I can take care of myself.
What was she to Creasy then?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
I don't think I remember him.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
What they say?
Marty.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Marty...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Okay.
Sure.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You gotta good heart.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
You gonna die without a son.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I heard you, Ma.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well...
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
On accounta...
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Never this close.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Back home.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Epidural hematoma?
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
Ravenous. What about you?
A football game?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I think I heard about that.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
What's the age of consent in this country?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You're an attractive man.
Ayuh.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You're leaving tomorrow?
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Duke...
What do you want with those two medical officers?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Oh. Yeah.
Me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
All set, Ann?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
What letter?
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
There is no letter. I made it up.
In what man!
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Have you seen him?
Where'd you play?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Yeah, you bet!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I don't know.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
You don't want to know.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
If you say so.
How do you feel after a shooting.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Recruited you from where?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You have to. It's a tradition.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Every couple of months, huh?
Yes.
Why?
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I do.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
The jockey!
How much you wanna bet?
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Damnit!
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Good question.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I ain't interested in your life story.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Just now.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Prude.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
The car is part of the deal.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Why --
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
In a computer program.
Not real?
And down here --
There is no --
-- I saw the program.
The truth.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Try harder.
Insurance.
Yes.
I know.
This.  No point to it.
-- Waiter.
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
Ryan's Comet!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
How about Major Moron?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
You've got the public upset, Al.
But I've never served a day.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Why should I be?
Life knocked me back.
No. Not everything.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
London?
But there's...
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
How soon can we pull this off?
I'll do fine.
They don't give a shit about us!
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Didn't know you felt that way.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not if they all die at once.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Spare us.
Guess I'm just lucky.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Olive or eyeball?
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Tell me what?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
We like to think so, yeah.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Mother!
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Aaron?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I can make my own decisions.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Moscow.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
You got worms.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
You play--left field.
That's taking place outside now.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Any time.
What?
What?
You said it!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
No wonder--without your dinner.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Yes, Jim.
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Oh, a *boy*!
Certainly. Step right in.
Why, of course.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Mr. President--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Just fine.
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
There *what* was?
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
Well--he's got nothing on me.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Some committee's got it.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
What's that?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Lena.
No--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Goodnight, Senator--
I'm splendid, too.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well--I--
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
I know that.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Okay. See you here.
No?
That's right.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
Yes--
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Order!
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Always.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No! I resigned last week!
But they did take place?
Yeah, let's.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Really?
Thank you.
In a day or so, I think.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
We're not going out tonight.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
No, thank you.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Huh?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
No, thanks.
Why should you?
I've got one for Cobb
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
They can have the Estate.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Why not?
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Oh, Mr. Deeds
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Not at all.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Yes, ma'am.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Mr. Cook.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
What do you think's wrong with her?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Oh?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
You like me. How come?
Where am I supposed to eat?
Doc.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
That would explain it.
Mother... go away!
There's something I think we need to talk about.
No.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I don't know if --
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
I don't follow you.
What was that?
Hello.
Will you think about it?
It's a big part of the show.
Have women found you attractive?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Good-looking woman.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
It's just a thought.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
What?
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
What friend? You're my only friend.
What does he want the book for?
Exactly --
Try me.
Broad?!
What did you find? What did you see?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
I know my treasure.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Something like that.
Not unless you call me Rick.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Did you ever see him eat?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Except for one little thing.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Do it, big boy!
But you're a superhero.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Should I kill them?
Against.
Roy.
Date?
Why?
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
And what if you get killed?
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
SO WHAT?
With what?
But look at him... and look at us.
So why don't you just tell her!
I can't.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
So what can I get you?
I use it... to fight evil.
This looks like a job for Superman --
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Fair enough.
I'm not insulted.
And who is defending Paris?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Let me see it.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
No, sir, none at all.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
You may go, Captain Charles.
A glass of champagne, please.
No, they're living in Nice now.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Why didn't you wake me then?
It is the work of incendiaries.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
What is that?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Only Lisette?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
No.
I don't understand you.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
Why not?
That's all I can say.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Send him in.
That's it?
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Yup.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Black magic.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I know, be still.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Still gonna smell it.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Well bring yo' ass on...
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Just hold your breath.
Come on.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
You don't wanna know.
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
I don't know.
Call me.
Sorry, my ass.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
That ain't gonna work.
'Take your car?'
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Aw, too bad.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Ah.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
What?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
You...
Tell me why I miss him.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
No way.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
Is within himself.
It's a twenty.
Oh, man...
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
What?
A surprise?
Yeah.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
No, Ben.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Twenty-five wives!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
It's a shame!
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Why?
Ssh...
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Now it's your turn.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
I -- no, I --
The Lord will provide.
When did I ever?
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Thank God.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Well what you reading it for?
How you plan to do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
What?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
She lived there.
It wasn't that serious...
Warm milk. Gross.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Nancy!
Dead and gone.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I see.
Evening gown?
Yes.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Or we can't go back to Russia!
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Right now it's on the balcony.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Shall we tell her?
The former Duchess!
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Go to bed.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Yes.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
A week?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Well, we're back home.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Me?
In other words you don't know.
And where are we?
I'll try.
That's a strange angle.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Don't do it, please.
It's twelve o'clock.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
This is a place for workmen.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Why?
On which boat?
Do you like Scotch stories?
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Did you make any change in this room?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
And General Savitzky.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Yes.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
All right, I'll listen.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Unfortunately.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask why?
You did say it, sir.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Then his office will be fine.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
I understand that, sir.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
How so?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Lincoln used it.
How do you see this?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
All right.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Run 'em over.
Sir?
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
When I met with him, he said ...
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
What?
Mr. Castro.
I know ...
The old queen did it on purpose.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
You're fucking me.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
We'll see about that.
She's quite pretty.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
... Use his women.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Elvis I like, too.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
The hell with 'em.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
That's right.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
No.
Thank you.
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
Don't be ridiculous!
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Someday, Dick.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
I'm... discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Uh-huh.
I don't know...
No sir.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I never do.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
No.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn --
Yes I do.
You should be used to that.
I can hear it in your voice.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Yes I did.
I don't need to talk to you.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Yes I do.
All right. Heads then.
They'll give you a wallop.
That's twenty-six dollars.
No sir, it's unusual.
I got beers in my room.
It's called a transponder.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
To kill your wife.
What outfit.
So she did witness it?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Yeah?
Tell him what you told me.
I know that...
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Oh, Betty --
No... what about your sister?
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
I gotta go make dinner.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Do what?
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Umm...
You still in love?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
I have to leave now.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Like what?
You told me how to do it!
What 'look'?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
I never said that I believed...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
I see.  May I?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
Huh?!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
That ain't it!
Suckin' away.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Uh-huh.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Million point two.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I am. Hur you?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
What for?
Why?
Who gave you this idea?
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Yes, Joe.
No, sir!
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly jets, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
And you turned him down??
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
God.
I can't risk it.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Sure.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
That's right.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
NOT THAT ONE?!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
You don't look so good.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Not at all.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
What?
Shoulda got an apartment.
478-0150.
What?!
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
Come on, come on...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
I saw something, I saw...
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Damn straight.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
No sir he didn't.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Wait a second there brother...
No man. Gonna walk.
I don't know about that.
Like the manual says, "Information is...
What are you saying?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
The hell I do.
He's my father.
Apology accepted.
I consider them linked.
Sir.
Perhaps.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
I understand, sir.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
He tried.  It didn't take.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
He left us.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
It's Mister Marion.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
Thirteen years...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
We saw.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Worse.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
Yaay!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Wouldn't wash?
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
It's beautiful!
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
That's forgotten.
Yes, I guess I do.
I'm sure.
That boat is my livelihood!
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
We got that part.  Anything else?
No you won't.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
That's right.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
I'll watch my back.
The situation has changed.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Or you could surrender.
Would that I could.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Yes -- yes.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
What?  He never told me that.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Pirate.
Move!
I'd die for her.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
You haven't seen it.
No.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
My apologies, Governor.
Where did he come from?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
It's ready now, I know it is.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Considering what?
If you loved me like I loved you?
That might work.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Shut up and do it!
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Aaabout...?
What did he want?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Like Crazy Glue?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Been out for six months now.
The big house.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
That's what I thought.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
You're insane.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
No, why?
What about it!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
It's still inside me?
I don't know.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
The same thing I suppose.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
The question is, are you?
And you have him?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes - Sing Sing.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, Stew
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Stewart!
Look! Look! The front page!
Is that so?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah?
Gloria Golden?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
and that
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
My error.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
There you are!
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Yeah?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
I have it here.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Now the lady said you may go
I just putter.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Very good, sir.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
No, no ... Come on in.
Oh, George ...
Oh yeah.
But where would we go?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Thank you very much.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
The basketball team?
Okay--that's enough!
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
YOU get lost!
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Owns the hardware store.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
Can we do any better?
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
It's okay.
That's great.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
It was a prop for the school play ...
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Where are you going ...
What?
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I didn't do anything wrong.
No you're not.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
What?
Hi.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Cool.
Yeah but what are you doing?
No, no, no.
Please don't.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I don't know.
Why?
It's fine, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
...yeah.....
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
No. I'm sorry.
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
Hi.
It's terrible, no.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah.
Yeah?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yes.
What did he want?
Ok.
...yes I did...?
I'll see you later.
Ok.
About six months ago. Why?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
It's ok to ask that.
For what?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
I didn't do it.
......and this is confidential?
Barry Egan.
-- and this is confidential?
It's ok, take your time.
What?
That's that.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Yeah.
Fine, thank you.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
WHICH?
What happened?
Ok.
Yeah.
Hi.
Please don't do this.
You have an ATM?
Is this where you live?
Are you serious with this?
I'm serious.
Seriously.
You can't be late though.
You can't just stay in your house.
I'll see you there.
It's not bad, it's ok.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Sorry.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
No one's forcing you to listen.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Yes, Abbe?
Not now, or we're both done for.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Why not?
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Of course.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
You find this amusing, do you?
And --?
I have.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
That's not our intent --
How is the patient faring?
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
What's that then?
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
Very much.
Last week would this be?
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
But I am That's the killer, honey.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
One . . . buys things.
This picture--
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
That's right
Can I talk to Hearst?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
How?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Kinda.
George...
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Yes.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Please don't ask me to do this.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
The ad..
No, we're jake. But listen-
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yes!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
And where you goin'?
None of your fuckin' business.
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Jack! Enough!
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
You know, like bang her or anything?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Where you been?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Just give it a nice little tap.
I was just...
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Yeah.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
You did?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
It don't look right.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Not yet.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like an old hambone?
For getting rid of that cast.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Gunnison?
Who are you?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Lisa Fremont.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Stella!
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
There's probably one in the basement.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Anything else bothering you?
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
For what?
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
To get on home.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Is he cleaning house?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Somebody find him a knife.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
What would you do, Dad?
We don't have time.
I was in it.
You don't want me to go.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going down there?
Open it.
What's the charge?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
They're still there!
No.  I'm scared.
I'm what?  What?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
No.  At dawn.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Chicken?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Now that's true!
Won't mother be proud.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
What?
We were romantic then too--
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Searching for a money man...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
He'll be dead when he does.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
I don't think it's negative five.
No, hey, I like your coat --
Yes it was all you --
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
You sold him out.
You told him about Nick's letters.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
No!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Not without you.
He working for them on this one?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
Well. I'm going home.
The hell I can't.
You what...
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
What's her greatest fear?
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
NO!
You need six.
No.
Six men means six guns.
How'd you know my name...
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Show's over.
OPEN IT!!!
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
You gotta get someone upstairs.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Haven't thought about it.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
And some pecan pie.
I'm just talking.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Standing right here, man!
And you set me up.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Now where were we?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Yeah.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What for?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
It's a surprise.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
I'm okay.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
A few cops.
Uh-uh, just cops.
Nope.
Where?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
No shit?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
What are you gonna do about him?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
He's learning his letters.
They're stragglin'.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
But the rest is right.
You're not going out to look for them?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
All right. I'll tell you.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
There's only two of them now.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
Kind of sore.
Three men on matched roans?
It isn't that --
But I want to stay.
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Depends on how good you drive.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
And you've got me all figured out?
Oh, sure.
Steve --
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Thanks.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I don't care. You pick.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Not in a thousand years.
Just wait, you'll see.
We? What do you mean... we?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Who?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
In about fifteen minutes.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Thanks, handyman.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
What she said about your mother?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Let me see!
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
Yes, I did.
...People who don't mind their own business.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
I beg your pardon?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
I do, please.
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I can't understand it at all.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
Drink your milk.
The people at the restaurant?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
Yes.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
You will die.
Devil worshippers!
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
She was my patient.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
I'd like that.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
It seems right to us.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I never thought you did.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
No, she's with her sister,
I didn't know.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'll be out in a minute.
She's not been here for a long time.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Please.
What?
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Younger.
How do you mean?
Do you want them?
Agreed.
You are?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
You had sex with you therapist?
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Not really.
Everything about sex.
Like what?
She said it on her tape.
Why not?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Absolutely not.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
That's very flattering.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
But that was part of it?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
You're not answering me.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
No.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Why?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Why?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
What?
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
And... do whatever it is you do.
No!
No, it's nothing like that.
Why did you do that?
No, but I did.
You are in trouble.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Did you take your clothes off?
There's a phone here.
Do I know you?
Nope.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Nothing.
Yes.
Yes.
Just a moment.
I would.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Why?
Could be risky.
Afraid of getting caught?
When?
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
I like the way he dresses.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Why not?
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
Graham.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
God, you... you're mean.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Not for three-fifty.
You have family here also?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Goddamit...
Yes?
Yeah.
All right, jesus.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
He sounded fine.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
That's the one.
OK. I'll think about it.
I don't get it.
Huh?
BREAKING OUT
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Fools!
I got it!  I got it!!!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Home?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little about it?
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Who?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
You're practically naked!
Do you really think so?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
F for...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Surely.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Yeah, I'm here.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
You are not.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
That's a good age.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Now we're talking.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Uh-huh.
You know her?
You know that chick?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
And she likes Pinot.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
So what's the plan today?
She what?  When?
I want to go home now.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
I will.  See ya!
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Deep.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Nope.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
What exactly are we going to do?
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Let me use your phone.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Uh-huh.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
I'm fine. You rest.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Yeah.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Sure.
Like what a fraud he was.
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
About two-thirty.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
That's great.
So how're you doing?
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
I guess.
I told you I need a drink.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
I'm not going to curse.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
Ray Reddy's house.
They already know we're here.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
From what?
I'm close.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
How do they know it's over?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Don't.
It's old Morgan.
I just asked his name.
The family room.
What was the first thing?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Okay.  So he was tall?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
What did you say?
They think it might happen all at once.
What do you mean, the horses?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
You're in here for winging a guy?
The one with the shotgun.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'm sorry.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
Not for five years.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
He is that.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
We didn't get that far.
That ain't right.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
What makes you think I could?
So we understand each other?
Stella.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Hair and make-up?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
You're so good to protect her like this.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Really?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Not if I don't let her.
How much wine have you had?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
So you did meet her?
Simone?
Who are you really?
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Hello, Hal.
For her?
How did the wall get there?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
Somebody said she was here.
I need flesh and --
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Is she here tonight?
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
I noticed.
She thinks you're with Simone.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I'm keeping it in trust.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Dark?
My God, you've got one?
What do you want -- ?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Thanks.
Congratulations.
You use needles?
She died a long time ago.
Something I want?
Dr. Crowe.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Maybe.
Standing next to my window.
...I don't know.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Bitch.
Bitch.
Not according to these.
...Hi.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Sorry.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Harvest moonshining!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I'll be fine here.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
It's you. You and your father.
No --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Second verse!
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
No. What?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Aspirin.
Shelby!
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Sure you do.
That's disrespectful.
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Margaret.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
How much style?
What do you think?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Eleven.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Bandit II?
What kind of a guy is he?
Yes.
I'm begging.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'll believe it when I see it.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Go breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
He's thirsty.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Maybe.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
You're sure?
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Damn... alright then.
Yeah, why.
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Without peer?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
No shit.
Got hit twice.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Fuck you.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
I can trust Rheya.
All right.
Listen --
What?
How much sleep?
And professionally?
Will she come back?
Told you what?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Get out --
No.
Into what?
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He has a point.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
I love you, too.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Rheya --
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Why do you say that?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Occasionally.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Can we go then?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
I got money.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah.  It was.
Very nice.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Claire, will you calm down?
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Too kinky.
What?
What did she say the down payment was?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
I'll be right up.
What're you talking about --
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What about Tommy?
Me neither.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Does it make you... hard?
Is she injured?
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Okay, I guess.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Be nice.
You stop him?
Cause if you get in a bind--
No, no.
Or was it all a dream?
Hm.  What a lump.
Harry
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
Can we make it a hundred?
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Well...
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
What?
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
I think I'd like that.
I'm here...
You sure about all this?
I know him.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I heard about Thorkel's order--
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
No
Like it?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
I'm not so happy myself.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
In this barracks?
Take it.
We're looking at it.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Don't wear it out!
Not you.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Interesting.
Jawohl?
Jawohl.
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Betty Grable!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
You're teasing me again!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Bombs away!
It's not good for you, Animal.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Says me.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Shoot!
Check.
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
When is it expected back?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
The station complement was nineteen.
I hope so, sir.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Where is he now?
Please, I insist.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Yes.  Thank you.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
Aye.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
The Nexus.
Thank you.
Aye, sir.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
I'll handle that later.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
I still don't...
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Why would you do this...?
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!

Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Of course...!
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Understood, my lord.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
I'm not a drama critic.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
It was just words.
Don't you believe it.
Raise them --
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Visual --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I'm going down to the station.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Or the one.
Too late --
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Uhura, patch me in --
Yes --
Or the one.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Scotty!
Try again.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
What do you think, Spock?
Cramps.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Can you isolate the wave?
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
I do not know your name.
I am? May I go now?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Hm?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's what?
I'm all ears.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
You need me.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
I see.
... I see.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
It is kind of you to make this effort.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Sulu Hikaru.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
For someone so young.
I'll be here.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
On screen.
Deck ten.
Aye, sir.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Would you like something to eat?
Gorch?
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
If that's true, they're a dying race.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I believe you...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Not yet.
At least four hours.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
I do not know what you are referring to.
I'm your creator now.
No.
Can you configure it?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
What's still there?
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
One minute to warp threshold...
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Active.
There's a few of us left.
Yes, he is.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
That's impossible.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Yes, sir.
We've lost Bridge control!
Hold that thought.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
To be -
I'm not sure how to take that.
Yes...
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Now we go to Starfleet?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Thank you, Captain.
Candidate for what?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
An omission. After that -
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
And if they're still in place?
Aye, aye, sir.
You are me.
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Dying?
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Aye, sir... This way.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Sir.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Do you have a name, sir?
Emergency force fields are holding.
The resemblance is... striking.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
How could I not?
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
This isn't about me anymore.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
What do we know about the population?
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.

With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
New Praetor?
On screen.
Still well on our side...
Away team. Transporter room four.
And the Senate supports you?
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
Yes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
He's a very unusual android.
Where did you stop last?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
This is George Fox...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Eh... police.
Police...
Coupons.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
I want to try it.
Yes. Day... night.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.
Eh... yes...
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
You want this ticket?
The car will stop?
Can I have the gun?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
I don't understand 'friend.'
Yes.
Hurry up.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Nothing.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
No.
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.
It was a man though... right?
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
A star is born.
Maybe later.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Maybe.
Can't do it.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
That's right.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Looks like she was holding out.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What clip?  What was it?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Coming with you.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Wants to share.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
That's where it gets a little strange.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
I guess.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Who knows.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What does the Manager say?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What kind?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Its called insubordination.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
I understand.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Yes.
How's the arm?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[What does the file say?]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
What's that like?
Why? You're not a real man?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything?
What else is going on?
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...Four days..?
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Did you get it?
He is so sweet.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
Six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
Hi, Mike?
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Fine... I guess. You?
I thought you met someone else.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I mean, I need the money.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Oh no?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What'd you get?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What Vegas?
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
She smiled baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You gotta do it.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
What?
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
Tomorrow?
No...
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Chelios to Roenick...!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...It's on.
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
...Definitely...
Be smart about it.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
I ask for Justice.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
You wanted me to be your son.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You look good, too.
Mike!
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Can you do it Mike?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Can you say it?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
What?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
I do renounce him.
I do wish to be baptized.
I can arrange security.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
I don't get it.
Did you speak to my father?
No, I like him.
Okay.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
It's just an undercoat. 
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
This is so good of you.
You're breaking my ribs!
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Such as?
I hope she never knows.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Sure.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
I think you're right.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
And you, sir? Any better?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Which is?
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Beating you away.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
You want to canvass?
Thank you, Travis.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Can I call you?
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
With who?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Ouch!
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
And what happened?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
One-Ball McCall?
Nah.  I suppose not.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
You want to make it like this? 
Don't you want to go?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Where is home?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
Yes I am.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
I know. I tried that.
You want to work uptown nights?
Anything you say, officer.
Iris?
I know.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Wrong.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
That always used to work.
I had it, a minute ago...
Through the door.  It comes apart.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Oh.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Start with what you knew then.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
... Ernie.
... what?
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Aren't you coming?
You should watch what you say.
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
I thought you...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
I think so.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
She already has a daughter.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Cathy!
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Well, I suppose...
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Where?
Mmmm.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Yes, very.
In a bird shop.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
When?
Where will we go?
Do I sound foolish to you?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
And locked it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
That's all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Lovebirds, sir?
Doesn't what make me...?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
We... we went to school together. College.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I'm sure.
Famished.
Oh. That. Rome.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
No.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I think it could be fun.
I have several jobs.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I'm glad you do.
No, tell me.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
I think I should, don't you?
Certainly, of birds.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
How long have they been gathering there?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
No... wait.  Hold me.
What do you suppose it is?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
What were the crows after at the school?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Of course.
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Did he tell you about Georgina?
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
No.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
The strip joint?
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
The scar.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I was talking about you.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Yeah, I know.
No...
It's what Lauren would do.
It's not. I can't take it.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
You know.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
It's not what you think.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
How does he explain that?
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will be in just a minute.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Looks real to me.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
How do you know?
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
I was.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I'm sorry.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
No -- no, thanks.
That's right.
They would have killed this man?
He's my brother.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Yeah.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Hit the lights again.
Chill out Edgar.
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
For what.
I thought we were poor.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
But, Mom...
-- a job.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
When?
Because I love you...
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Just listen.
So what's our problem?
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
You lying bastard...
He's gone already!  Do it!
You been made, MacReady.
For your health.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
All in Norwegian.
Enough, MacReady!
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
What's that?
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
I had an accident.
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
Where?
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
1899.
What are you?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
Yes.
Last night.
Send him away.
This way.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I will...
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
No...
I'm a foolish man.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
You know I can't.
No... let's walk through the city.
Do you know you were humming?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
I would.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Thank you...
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
You liked it there.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Mara...?
Do you have it?!
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Tell him to go away --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Exactly correct, sir.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
I did...
New Yorkers.
They've gone to a better place.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
We are what we are.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
But... what about Starks?
We never should have done this to him...
Depends on what you're seeing.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
[Beat] You're his son?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
What for?
[Beat] What?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Why?
[Beat] I don't know.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
I don't understand.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
So it's helping?
2004.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
How...how do you know?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
I do believe you...
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
I wasn't talking about anything.
So what am I supposed to do?
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
[Beat] Thanks.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
I'm sorry.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
Hon?
What?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Aw, God.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Who do you think did it?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
I have no problem with that.
It's him.
My Lord.
Oh, definitely.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm choking on it.
In the back?
Am I in trouble?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
In case of what?
Yeah!
Maybe.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
But you think he fools around.
It's probably not a good idea.
What did Darryl say?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
She thinks he's a pig.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Taking a shower.
You think you've found your calling?
What for?
You're right.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Hit it.
Yes.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What do you mean?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
We've gone insane.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Why?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Never?
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You're kidding? What did they say?
Well... at least now you know.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
The sawbones?
Dumbshit.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
How about -- ?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
A fucking moron.
Huh... that's strange.
Sure.
Any idea where I might start looking?
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Kim and I are close friends!
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Hm?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
What's a mook?
I don't watch the new ones.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Where's Puffy?
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
And did everything -- ?
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Why not?
You're Woogie?
You forgot your keys!
Really?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
I wasn't trying --
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Says what, Kenny?
I said his heart, not his attention.
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
No you weren't.
I was, you bastard.
Not as far as the election goes.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
I know, I know...
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
Watch out!
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
Why should I tell you.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Ray --
What'd you expect to hear?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
Great.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Where were you?
Two miles.
For what?
Harmless!
How about what?
What about the plane?
Anything.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
About as much as they think about killing me.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Where?
Anything.
Do what, show you a good time?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
Yesterday.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
What truth?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
NO. NO GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
Mister to you.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Time to go.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You saved our lives. You did it!
Figured out what?
Need a hint?
Tell me one thing.
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
For the same reason you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
And you get a kickback.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Who are you?
Definitely.
Fuck you.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Hetero.
I'm listening.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
There!  The woman!
On his way.
Melina!
Well don't.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Oh God, Doug.
The hell you're not.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Nice to meet you.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Aliens built it.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
You can't fight'em that way...
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Nope, there!  That's one.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
That's the plan.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Great.  Thank you.
I think we wait right here.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And one good guy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Not at all --
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Right. You're right.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- You found his mugshot?
...What do you mean?
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
-- Roger -- ?
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Want to tell me what went down here?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
What went down?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Y-yes, sir.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
I am going over here.
Was there an argument?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Smell something fishy, huh?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
Teresa Banks.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
No.
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's late, Sam.
She must have known someone.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Maybe.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Laura, I am your friend.
Cause I like it.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
What does Bob say?
I'm not.
Send me a kiss.
Let's go all the way.
I can't tonight.
"Oh, Laura..."
What?
You want to see...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
I understand.
What were you doing in my room?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Fine.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It was good of you to meet...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I. Yes. It is.
Thank you.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Hi. How are you doing?
One hour.
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...
Overruled...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Do you want me to go...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
I...
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
From the magazine?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
...fifty thousand dollars?
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
They still have to take it to a jury.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What did she do?
The Hospital...?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't want a mistrial.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
In New York?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Yes.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
Right.
Looks like the fishing was good.
It's always been a good persuader.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
So I don't know about horror.
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
I don't follow.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
I'll be there in three hours.
Is he all right?
What?
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
You have a fever, sweetie?
Bye.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
A story?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Really?
Yeah, sure.
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
You're kidding, right?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Now?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
We were idealists.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Okay.
Yeah.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Me either.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Is it true Phil?
I know enough.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Yes sir.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Twice.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
We'll think of something.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
You know what he is talking about here?
It seems we're short on singers.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Why? He's right in the groove.
Y'all take American Express?
Fuck me.
You black?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Why not?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Thanks.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Whattaya do there?
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
This 'bout the fifth time?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
You do.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Oh shit...
There's worse places, honey.
What's that?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Let's leave here.
What could I be up to, Lula?
Shake hands with your daddy.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
What if I asked you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Shoot him.
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
How are you, Crabtree?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He heard everything we were saying.
Tripp, where the hell...
James? My James? What's happened?
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Which is?
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Such as.
You did.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
You're in Kinship?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Really.
Like the lady herself.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
Yea, James.
You?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Is he all right?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
How did I get here last night?
So where have you been staying?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Where's that?
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
The hell I am.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Okay.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I'm a little worried, James.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
But where? I need the street.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
I got the message you called too.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Yes.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
And the jacket?
I think I might have.
And what did you say?
Dozens. It's very sad.
Oh?
Does he still love you?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Grady?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
I don't know. It might be...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I was thinking of you.
Maybe I should read it.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
I might have his number on campus.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
How is she?
I'm working on it.
What's that?
Isn't it?
It's just a city park.
I have no idea.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
They grow outside, don't they?
I don't know.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Can I ask how old you are?
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
They sound like finches.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
You think reflection is good.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I'm not that crazy.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
I don't know!
Go home, Walter.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
It was a small house.
How do you feel about that?
I'm talking about you.
What's weird about that?
I'm just quiet.
I'll buy a plant.
Yeah, they could.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Not tonight.
You think I have a problem?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
Is that all?
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
It's not what you think.
Why young girls, Walter?
What?
What odds?
The percentages --
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Us seeing each other.
Move in with me.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Where're you?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Wasn't up to me.
Who else?
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
No.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Yuh?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
He's hallucinating badly.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
But you just said that a month was too...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
At what?
And how do you explain that?
Then I'll go with you.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
And what about you?
Aren't you going to change?
I'm too sleepy.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Late, very late.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
To do what?
You say that just to flatter me.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
What is it?
Yes, yes, of course.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
No, not like this one.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
No. The owners are in Australia.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
I don't know.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Everyone.
Uh huh.
Oh, there are so many.
Do you think he loves you?
Often?
And you like that?
Would you like to talk about it?
And then what?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Don't you know?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Somebody told her.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
She can.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
No I'm not.
Who am I?
And why am I here?
Because I wasn't worthy.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
I have to throw up...
Why isn't anyone coming?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
???
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
What about Roger? He's free.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
How do you survive?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Yes... I...
None as far as I know.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
That possibility never occurred to you?
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
What?
Aquittal.
I don't think I care to know.
I knew that after the fact.
Oh, God.
I know you don't.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Hand rolled.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
You think she's a saint?
Who is he?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Was it you?
Yes.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
She didn't want any help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
She can't remember.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Sorry? 
Bag-snatcher.
Do I snore?
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
But I won't.
I don't care.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
No, straight up.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Yes.
You can learn from books.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
What?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
That's all right then.
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oink! Oink!
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
And my nose...
What have you heard?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
You've lost him.
No, we're not!
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Do I have to raise me voice?
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
What's the terrain down there?
Then take her down.
Looks like a derelict.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'm on my way.
No, I want to go in.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Hard to say.
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
Why, what's wrong?
Dead.
It's still in the ship?
What?
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Boy, that's terrific.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
Does anybody know what happened?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Can you get them back?
Oh... God...
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Is it armed?
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Sun will be down in a minute.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Maybe we could write it together.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
Close...
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Let's hear it.
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
With great pleasure.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
That'll blow the ship up.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Do you want a tablet?
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Yep...
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
What's our weapons situation?
Has anybody talked to them?
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Take a look at this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Where does that lead to?
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Want some?
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
I... I can't!
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Almost four.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
She doesn't know.
You sat and talked until it was light...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
What of it?
No-no-no...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
Then you've heard too.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
We have that in common.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Eve! My understudy...
Frankly, I don't remember.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
I'm a junk yard.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Sing it?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
See you...
I thought you were going to be late-
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
I don't think that's funny!
- guilty.
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
I will not calm down!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I've been aware of that for some time.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Yes, dear.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Your make-up's a little heavy.
Find out.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Like an agent with one client.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
They'll do as they're told.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I'm not crying.
I wish I could believe that.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
There are other plays...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Harrington.
I detest cheap sentiment.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
That was a pity...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Now just a minute!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Up in the room.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
I'm sure.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
I never said it was!
You know, she probably means well, after all...
What's your being married got to do with it?
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Play it again.
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
How about me what?
All you got to do is name it.
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--see?--
'68.
You want me to be the bastard.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
--shit--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Maybe we are...
Goddamnit!--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--jeeeeeeesus--
Night.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
And?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
Absolutely--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Hey, easy...
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
No games, Irwin; give.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
How senior?
Look, I told you inside--
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
To where?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Good God!
I couldn't say.
It is.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
When so ordered.
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Suck me...beautiful?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Why is this?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Stifler told me.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Then don't.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I don't get it, that really works?
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
I'll save you a seat.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Don't you want me to?
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You think so?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
How?
Just a second!
Okay.
I don't know.  How do you?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Dude, he does not.
No way.
Exactly.
Uhh! Would you die already!
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
What?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Uncle Terrence.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
How to read.
When you're older . . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Not you. Him.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
It's the best fork of all
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Don't be
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Rasputin!
Run, Anya -  go...
You gave the orders!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Come on.
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Why not?
It's okay.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Well, stop listening to him.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Get him!
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Yeah.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh.
Well... thank you again.
You sure?
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
No, so help me.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
What?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Oh.
As Balzac said...
Oh, yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
M'hm.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I know you've only known me a short while.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Yes, it is.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
M'm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
and I keep, you know, it's-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
It was just great!
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
It's for my complexion.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
What-
My head is throbbing.
You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.
I mean that as a compliment.
Trigger.
You're crazy!
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Yes, I do.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Would it make a difference?
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
I'm not that good.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Who, Sally?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What what's about?
He's allergic.
Why would she care?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Oh my God, the sitter.
And you're not the wife.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Please?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did.  Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
Monica.
Oh.  You're them.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Beats a lawsuit.
I mean, you're really back.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
That is not true.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Anyone else?
I'll never forgive you.
Sure.
Come on, Panes...
No.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Ah.
I meant Sally.
I'm a little nervous, so...
No you're not.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Come here.
I'm so sorry.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I don't need a drug.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
Sally?
I so wish I'd known.
Yes.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
So tell me, how's it going?
That's not an answer, is it?
Relax.  You've done enough.
And here they are!
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
So how much do you hate her?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Neither does Joe.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Hlllllllp!
And only you can become a Queen?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
There's something going on, Z --
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Oh, of course --
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Yeah, I know.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Fine.  Wait.
Good night.
No.
You mean tonight?
What time does the show go on?
No -- I like it.
I think so.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Baxter.
What's her first name?
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
No, I don't.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
You usually eat alone?
What?
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Fine. How's your eye?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
What for?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Put me down for Thursday again.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
You left your wife?
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
What does he mean, accident?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Now will you get out?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Just as long as she's okay.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Well, you can't win 'em all.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
No kidding.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
My shoes.
Doctor.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Yes, I know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I missed you, Fran.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I want you back, Fran.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Remember what we talked about?
I love you -- remember?
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
Atlantic City?
I told you -- with my mother.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Dreadful.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Esprit de corps --
Part.
Sort of.
Fat. That's real fat.
Sometimes.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
How?
Probably is.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Signs?
What is it?
Listen.
Too far inland.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
Don't you agree?
It'll get here, soldier.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
When?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
No -- leave it --
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
Cognac?
The war will still be here tomorrow.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
26   CONTINUED:  
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
That's right.  You're not.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
Too bad we're heading west.
How many do you see?
It's a spring day...
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.

Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
We'll go with you.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Stay out of it.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Emergency room only.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
What do you care?
Yes.
No, sir...
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Welcome.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
Never.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
All right, cut me a break.
No. No. Get Carol.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Do it.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
What?
Maybe this can wait.
Please, just leave.
Get out.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Does it matter?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
What restaurant?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Okay, don't.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I don't believe you.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
It cost us.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
An assassin?
What does that mean?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Better than playing with yourself.
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
Thinking.
What?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Not even a stalemate?
Taiwan.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Transmits and receives.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Yes.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
I didn't notice them.
No.
Why?
Yes.
Honestly?
Martin.
Electra --
Oh, God.  I see it!
Yes.  Please come in.
All the time.
Why not?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
I hope not.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
That's exactly what I told myself.
What are you thinking about?
Yeah.
That's correct.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
But we are underground?
And not even then sometimes.
What's that? Free!
What did the beer cost?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No beer?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
What happened to Katka?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Lucky break!
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Here's the details.
Yeah, maybe.
No way Doug, I can't.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Don't worry. Thanks.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
What is bail?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Yeah, but it was okay.
That's right.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
You are quite sure it's secure?
I. Don't. Dance.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Why not?
About a job.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
-- Obviously.
Were?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
In 76 years, me neither.
In ten words or less?
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I wanted this to be a date.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Where?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
I was twelve.
That's what I mean.
I'm not going back to school.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Lead man.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
That's right. You just act like one.
I want to come back.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
You don't. That's the point.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
You're welcome.
A similar triangle?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
But he does! Don't you see?
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Learn anything?
Lemme see that.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here... 
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Ssshhhhh!
The power converter...
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Jesus!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
A Tab.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What did you do to yours?
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
You don't mind?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Quit my job.
Don't ask me.
Yeah.
Positive?
I'm serious.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Just thinking.
Git.
Hold it right there.
Wanta sue me?
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Same one you had yesterday?
To get my guns.
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Better than him.
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Please, Barton.
No, no 
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
Well... actually, no Bill...
Then who should I talk to?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Go ahead, son.
What do you mean, Barton?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Ready... wrestle!
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
I apologize, Barton.
Well, some of his throat was there.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
No.
Yeah.
A couple days ago.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
How about the coke?
No.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
I know who you are.
About a year and a half.
If that's the way you want to play it.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
She wiped out her whole family.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
What if I call you Nicky?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
I'll risk it.
To see if I can get away with it.
When?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Come over here and tell me no.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
How did it end?
No thank you.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Cocaine.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
You did.
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
You don't like punk rockers?
Say what?
Catherine told me what was in it.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Yeah.  I know.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
I said keep it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
When's your show?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
I don't like beer.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
I'm here.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Yeah.
Out?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
About what?
So then what?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Don't you think he's using you?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
George?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Some of them.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I'll make you another one.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
No, actually I feel worse.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
You first.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
PMS.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
I recognized the accent.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Be ready for anything.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Surf's up.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wish I knew.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
What say we turn up the heat?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What do you mean?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
It'll never work.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
...A bat.
And another name for Mystery?
Just checking, young sir.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
We'll talk some other -
La'chiem.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Well, I met someone...
I said I'm sure he did.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Touchy, touchy.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Who is it?
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Shouldn't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Odd desire for anyone.
... We could try that.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
... Behind the makeup?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Yum, yum.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
You okay?
Did you really ask?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
David?
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Of course he is.
The TV.
This sucks.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
My butt's bothering me!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
You mean there's mre than one?
Cool, huh huh.
Huh? Huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Thrr...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Where are his pants?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Uh, ten uh...
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Adam!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Oh... I'm sorry...
What?
This is going to take some time.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Three times.  Powerful number.
All right.
What?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
Really.  I don't know.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Can you scare them off?
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
Life is just... too awful.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Just <u>say</u> it.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Otho'll know what to do.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Delia will cook...
Any particular kind?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Why not?
But not for long...
An attorney?
No.
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
... But he's...?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Oh, yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Your family doctor?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
So am I, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Thank you, Eve.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Do you think so? Do you think so?
I agree.
And I'm Ben.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
No, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Is his back feeling better?
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
How were you paid?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Yeah...
Good night.
Look, Johanna...
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
So...? Where the hell is it?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Malkovich!
Please, have a seat.
What?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You fell in love with her first.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Sure, after a fashion.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Thank you, sir.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
Is that true?
Why not?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
What's he been in?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
I've fallen in love.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Hush, sweetheart.
You can be John Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
No, I didn't know that.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
When?
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
One hour.
Never heard of it.
Is there dancing?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Lotte called me.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
You've got to be kidding.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You on your way home?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I will.
What you want?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning, ma'am.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
The church!
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Aw, no, Ella.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
No use thinking these things now.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Paul D.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Walter, how--
I was bowling--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Far out.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
I'm unemployed.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Oh yeah?
"Johnson"?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Well--sure, I could do that--
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
She most certainly was not!
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Uh-huh.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
Hey man--
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
I told him if it was during league play--
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Uzi?
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
Thanks Walter.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Yeah, and you were--
Come on, Walter!.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Who is this?
Right, Dude.
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
WHAT?!
Well. . . yeah.
All right, get out.  Both of you.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Sounds like a plan.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Not alone.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Scud.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Just do it, old man.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
I don't buy it.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
But, he could've --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Preventive medicine.
You don't know that.
Look closer.
How long have we been driving?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
You're a week early.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Then what is it?
But you use blood banks --
You've been listening in the whole time?
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Bullshit! Talk!
What're you doing there?
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
--Christ almighty--
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
--whatever; that's her.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Anna--
You said the name "James."
--bullshit!
What'd you dream?
Here.
I can't.
--no, what's wrong with you?
Why?
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
I know, I know.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Ask me what I don't have.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Still don't see it--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
--I don't know.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
Anna's the witch.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
--shit!!!
Why she kills children.
--and we brought it back with us!
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
--I know!
She's far from "fine."
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
It won't?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
...Mm-hmm.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
You're bad.
Ever durned one.
What?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
No.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
What's the point?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Tuesday.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
You want to see him too, right?
Nobody.
No.
No. please. I won't.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
What?
No.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
I asked first.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
There ya go.
How is Central these days?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Okay, okay. Bye.
What did you see?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Okay. okay.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
It's good to see you.
... You look beautiful.
I can't dance fast.
No.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah?
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
On the plane.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
You'll see for yourself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
It's garbage.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Excuse me?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
The coca is my responsibility!
Excuse me?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
It's your grass.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
You?
For calling you a homo.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Murder.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must.  It's the only way.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
We're half a million off.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
This is not the time, Diego.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Money.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I'm sorry, George.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Tough spot.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
What do you guys want?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I like fire.
But this is...
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Well, here I am.  See?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
There's schools in California.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Dien Bien Phu?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't do that kind of thing.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Go away.
I think it'll be a success ...
No, and neither were my men.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
Why?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
I don't know.
An inquiry into what?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Then how did it get into his body?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
About a year and half ago.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
She was.
Thank you.  The State rests.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
No.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
No.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
Yes -- quite easy.
High school?
Then -- those are not your own words?
How?
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Yes -- she did.
It won't be that hard.
You and me -- making love.
You take a lot for granted.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She allegedly humped him to death?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
No, Your Honor.
You better.  Please answer the question.
Really.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Some example you set.
Why didn't you come to me?
It's more involved than that.
Daddy -- stop it!
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
Oh Jesus.
No.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
That's it!
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Not yet. You want to go?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
That's it.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Want another cigarette?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
You sound like an artist.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
What?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Oh, how is he?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
I had a temper.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Uh-huh. And?
WHY?
Then he can move! People move!
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
He yours, sir?
What the hell you talking about?
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Those 'fools' are my people.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Your father.  He was your father.
You moved into this block?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Lucky thing.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Potential toxic dump site.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
But the place burned to the ground.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Give it to me.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
What are you, drunk?
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
They were in a car accident.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
What?  How about a drink?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Caesar is your husband?
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Sure.
A beer.  Of course.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
No.
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Yes, it is.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What are you afraid of?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What you heard wasn't sex.
He hung it up.
That's his brother.
What happened?
What did Gino drink?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
If he does ...
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I think we're going to find out.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I think everything is okay.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...which one are you?...
What is Treadstone?
I don't know.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.

One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
His brother.  You know his brother?
We thought you were gone for good.
It's a little late for that.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
What are you talking about?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
That's it?  Is that it?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
What?
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
What's that?
All of them?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
How did I get here?
Uh - what? - I ...
I fixed it myself.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... get to it.
What? You mean you've got ...
It's reply paid.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
No.
A heavy Christmas present.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Go away.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Oh, good!
I did it for you.
Yes.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
You remember Samuel, my son.
Mistake?
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Er, yes ...
What? Who is this?
Thank you, Dawson.
Central Services.
Fixed?
Not ... as such ...
We'll be back.
Emergency procedures.
Are you saying this is illegal?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Where is she?
You're going to live.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
No way, man.
What did you say?
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
I know him. That's Noel.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Did you see my father?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
Okay.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
No, no.
I need to sit down a minute.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Frank.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Yes.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
I've taken that into consideration.
What do you want to break?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Do it!
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You're burned out.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
What?
Hold it down, okay?
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Did you shoot their boots?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Okay, great -- good luck.
No.
Then it went well.
No.
I lost six pounds...
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
This is important to me.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Sit down, stop.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
You didn't say anything to her?
Outside?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
He said something about...
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes.  How do you know?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I like "godsend."
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Uh-huh.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
I know.  I taped it.
Okay.  Good night.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Shh!
Righto.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Oh...
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Sorry...
Every word...
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
I admit it.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Well I was uh, just looking...
Yeah.
Well...
I don't have another cat!
They are?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Uh, I don't know.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
What do you get?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
You don't have to do anything!
Then let me give you something then...
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Bummer metaphor.
You think?  Split?
I'm fine.
Wheels?
Down there.
What's playing there?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
No, you didn't.  When?
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
You sure?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
For the dance.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Please.  It's so '91.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
You look way pretty, Kim.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
In Virginia.
China.
All right.  What do we do now?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Who we gonna beat?
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Your turn.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Oh.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Buffy...
It isn't important.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
I'm just a girl.
Good.
You're kidding.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Nuke?!
No, no, it was great.
it's okay..
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Let me.
I want to be had.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
You okay?
Yeah...you a witch?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
He'll learn.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Oh both of you, of course...
Never heard of 'em.
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You been in the Majors?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
What?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We'll be praying for you.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
It's a miracle.
...and one helluva guy.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Jim looking for somebody.
Liar.
I was in the building!
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Wait, hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Lester...
Eight.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
What?
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Listen...
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
...very difficult to get in.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
...don't do it to me...
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Well...
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
No, Ace.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Nice to see you, Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I - I - I...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, it's so soft.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Okay.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Why do you need that much?
I didn't take your pills.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I gotta tell ya...
Yeah.
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
But it was just mine.
They had all the pieces they needed.
...and hypocrisy.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
Green?
Yeah?
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Please.
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey!
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Okay.
Now move along.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He's not here?
How are you?
Fine, fine.
And I mean... that's no good.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Ma che cazzo!
Mm.
Mm.
Fine.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
All right?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't - 
Yeah.
Hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
I did what you told me to.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Exactly.  He hates me.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
It's what you want?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost?
Okay?
I'm here.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
This is Nick.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
You have to dial nine first.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
What little boy doesn't?
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Men, huh?
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
But I'm blind.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
You could've killed us.
Why would I do that?
Yes sir.
You never miss a trick.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
And stop with the directions.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I improved on the fucking original.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
You won't disconnect.
Who?
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
26th off Wilshire.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
She's gone --
What do you mean?
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
What's going on?
It won't be him.
No.
Did you hear that click?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
You're all three of you in that van?
Can you walk?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
You're going to let them get away with this?
You timed that beautifully.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
L.A.P.D.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
What's that supposed to me?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Only one way to find out.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Keep talking.
There are no guarantees in this life.
What time frame have you got in mind?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Got a phone in that van?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I don't know what you mean.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
My pleasure --
I'm backing up.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
We're gonna get there first.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Let her tell you.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
See what, Dil?
What would you call it?
I would expect he does.
Fucking men, Col --
You heard me --
Maybe.
It's a simple question.
What's his name?
No.
Who's she?
They all get the wrong idea.
Perform?
You on the game?
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
How different?
Tell me about him.
Did you do that to him?
Yes...
You say that like a gentleman.
What does that mean?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Where?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Nothing's wise.
You gonna tell me why?
Not here.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
I'm sorry.
What?
You didn't.
You tried.
Stop it, Dil --
More what?
I like you, DIl
Then say it.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Have a look at him.
He's hot.
I know.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
It's your decision.
Are you all there?
Yes.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Would make me feel better about it.
I'm sure.
He's at home.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
How is it a farce?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
So I've noticed.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
What the fuck were you doing here?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
My special friend.
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
Yeah?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You don't know me, do you?
Who gives a fuck.
You're crazy --
Give me the fucking shooter!
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
Adam --
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
Here, give it to me.
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Describe him.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
No.
The last one, please.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Oh.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Sure.
You can't.
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Maybe.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Hm?
No --
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Shut the door!
No -- not yet.
I don't believe it.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
What's its value today?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
I don't know anything.
Swiss.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Voil what?
No, Jean-Louis.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Peter Joshua.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
I don't think I follow you.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
What?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Be careful, Peter.
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Yes?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
We will separate -- you look over there.
We want that money -- now!
Why?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
No I wasn't.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She's still a virgin.
This will relax her.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.

You're not?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Why?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You Miss Dunlop?
You know I want to go with you.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Not that I know of.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
Hide your laptop here.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Oh...
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where's Sam?
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...

You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
Are you kiddin'?
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
...the ice cream for money!

 Nice job back there.

 No...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
I think...
Oh, shit.
Okay. 
Come on.
What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
...to him!  You don't know who...
Oh, shit!
No!

...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...truck.
We were nationally  ranked.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  It was your friend...
Yeah.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...

Whoo!

Come on.  Come on.

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Hold this. 
What'd you come back for?!

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Who drove the ice cream...
 Yeah.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
Oh, oh!
Ooh.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're worried...
...about him.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
...without compunction.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
However, you are also non-en-...
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.

...I wish they would've let me say something...
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...that.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
...happen if I drop this?
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
EXT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
We were called in by the Jerome base...
 But...
Where's their protective...
...gear?
Mornin'.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Quite a getup for jacking...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
I assume you have one.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
...-tainer!


I can handle it.
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, no?
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. 
What's going on, colonel?
...son.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

...the master of his realm.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Everything will die, Mason.
Doctor.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Forty-seven.
Got that?
...beer.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Heat's murder.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
A ruler?
Thanks.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
Yeah.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
I think I'll kill her.
No thanks.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
Why?
The apple core?
Who?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Yeah.
I guess not.
Gittes, stay outta this.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Mrs. Mulwray?
But he wasn't killed.
How did you find out?
Did he know?
That your maiden name?
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
So you married your father's business partner?
Know him?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
I gave everybody the night off.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Where are you going?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
She's not tied up!
What does it look like?
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Back to Mexico.
I'll take care of it.
With us.
Okay...
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
When did you come in?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Hope so. He's working for us.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Never?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Who?
...Yes of course.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
But that's what you told your wife.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
That's right, Modern Times.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
Then where's the money?
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
What does it say there?
I'll write it myself.
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Enthusiastic?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Certainly not.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Ask them to sit down.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
Yes - Mr. Kane.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm sure that's it. 
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Toothache.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
No.  They've passed on.
In the water.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me -
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Susan!
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Do you know what that is?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I've got to think of Emily -
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
You can hold me down.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
God, isn't he great?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
I'm giving him his ring back.
There's more, isn't there?
Jesus, you're caustic.
You work in a market, all right.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Then who operated the store?
I can pass!
Yes.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Peptic ulcer.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Eight and a half?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
All right, Vader's boss...
Which ones?
All of them.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Yeah, right.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's embarrassing?
Reach what?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Exactly.
Not yet. 
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
You're bullshitting.
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
Because I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
What did she say?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Could be.
Lovely story.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
How do you know that?
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Nothing personal.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Yeah, but...
Here. Now leave me alone.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
I'm serious...
Something like thirty-six.
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
It stings a little.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's your cousin?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Yeah!
I hope it feels good.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
Which one?
Dental School.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Who's shooting?
It can't fly in this weather.
I love you, too.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Not on that leg.
Is it really four thousand?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Sure you can.
Three...
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
We spent a night there one night...
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
He can handle it.
Can't do it.
You know me, I'm a night person.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Up ahead.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
We don't have time to argue about it!
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
You're looking at him.
Then it's a deal.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
No names, this is an open line!
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
You bastards... bastards.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Been punished, yeah?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Try the wine!
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
No, sir, I feel really great.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
What job and how much?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Fine, fine.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
Crime?
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
How're you feeling this morning?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Yes!!!
I haven't seen you before.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
What?
Travel...and things.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
You're kidding me.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
I'm sorry.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
What?  What did you say?
Federal?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
...if they're wrong?!
I brought you flowers.
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I tried it.
How long, you figure?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Tonight it is.
Yes.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
No you don't.
Am I collateral?
I never learned jazz.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
What difference does it make?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
You get benefits?
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Slow down.
Let her go.
Any special reason?
Geronimo?
I, uh, I have some problems.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Yeah.  I think so.
What newsletter?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Is this your dad?
Please put it down.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
This way.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
I don't understand.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Then tell me what happened.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Could you be a little more specific?
I don't know...
Whatever.
<u>Why you</u>?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Only on the football field.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
It was.  It was.
A dog.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I don't understand.
Agent Lowry?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Tell me.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
Well --
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
How can that be?
It's beautiful.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
It's a civilian facility.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Because I can't.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
That isn't the way it works.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
That's my girl...  Lights.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
That's my girl.  Done.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
But what about your research -- ?
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
How do you mean?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
I don't think so.
Why?
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Oh.  I brought you something.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
But --
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
No.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Hey, Tattoo!
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
We got it locked in the sock.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
How about you tryin' to make me?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
What did I do?
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Hal has it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
Yes.  I believed him.
What Friday?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Where are you, Peter?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Because I'm all you've got.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
Let me get a little action started here.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'll get a locksmith.
They all have one...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Who prescribes the brandy?
Who came in after you?
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Tell it to your shrink.
Let's get out of here...
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
It is?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
It does.
Have you seen his penis?
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
What about the engagement party?
Really?
Truly.
Do you think I should?
That's thanks to all your help.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
A deal's a deal.
Don't be fresh.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
There's a spider in my room.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
By color.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
Tell the doctor.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
And did you go to the mission?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Shhhh.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Thanks.
Bingo.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Why'd you tell?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
I'm calling in sick.
I don't feel like going to work today.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
No, no.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I'm really sorry.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
No.
What?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
No, I'm good, Angelo.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I assume you want something?
I only have your word for that.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
No problem.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
We have to find Sophie.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
I just thought that--
Hard to say.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
What is it you do, Sami?
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I said a clean break.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
No thank you.
Wait here.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Glenmorangie.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
You got it in a bar?
The lucky ones.
It's not your fault.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
This Jade Fox is a woman?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
I'm bored.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Kneel!
Give it back!
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
Give it back.
Jen...
Good.  And how are you?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
I knew she would intrigue you.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
I don't know...
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
What do you have in mind?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
You buying?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Don't thank me.
No further.  I'm serious.
I saw it, too.
How 'bout the morgue?
Who?
Mister Funboy.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Elly...
I think he's yours, now.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Shut up.
Leather purse...
No shooting.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
I know.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
A friend wrote me.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
It's my house.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
How about tonight?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
I'm... I'm alright.
What are you doing?
You're not gonna start that again.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Where are you going?
Good for you.
It was perfect.
What are you saying?
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Absolutely.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
That's great.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Did you hide the letters?
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don't know.
Well... not exactly.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Same time next week?
Honey, is something wrong?
Jesus!
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
I'll be right there.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point... though why should I care?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Even there?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
But who will they turn to for help?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Any day now.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning.
So what went wrong?
Where'd she go?
Excuse me?
I accept. Now get out.
Excuse me.
Is that so?
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I did?
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about Oliver's first marriage  and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy  although he'll never realize it.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Irena.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You're shouting at me.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
It was just a voice.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
But why?
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Will you come soon?
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Who is she?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Your lips look delicious.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
People notice you Frida.
You're just saying that.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
And she got the medium.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
No, did you fuck him?
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
At least your PMS is over.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
You're just saying that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Okay, I gotta go.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I do development for TV movies.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Since when do you care?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Yeah?
Script coverage?
No?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
What are they for?
Okay, you busted me.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
I love you too.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
She's just so... pathetic.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Spinning backwards?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
How will we interrogate them?
Loose ends?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Well be more careful, please.
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
No...  No doctor...
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
Yes.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Your name is John White.
Well...
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
I have to go...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
We are...  living in their dreams...
How do you know I'm innocent?
They're dead, John.
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
The usual...
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
Right and don't embellish.
... Alright.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Well it's a last minute change.
I'm... not... nobody...
Yeah.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Mild stroke?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Fine.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Then we'll all go to jail together.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
What?
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
This is wrong, Alan!
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Ah.
Yeah.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What about it?
I had a feeling.
I don't mind.
What?
You find people jobs?
I sure fall for some weird guys.
I missed...
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
What you wanna do?
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
No wonder they're so....hungry.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
MARY!
Sir!
I'm alright. Let's go.
Don't come.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
So?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
Stop what?
Chet...
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
But, Chris...
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
But I love you.
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
What is that?
Courtyard?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
A barbaric yawp.
Again!  Louder!
Don't stop!
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You have another choice.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Todd Anderson.
What?
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
what?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
I have a schedule...
Then you better start swimming.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
Not like him.
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
Joey...look at me...
I'm stuck...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
And what have you come up with?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
John...
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
Get the boots.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Hey! Fuckin' A!
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
You are frightened, no?
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Yeah?
Now he's back.
Oh, well...
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Sure.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
C'mon. I've got the car.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Right here.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
No.
No.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Down ribbon!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Kimberly!
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Your mother.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Put that on your political resume.
When you bring in Doucet.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Not anymore.
You're crazy.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Thanks.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You treat her nice.
...Have you been drinking?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Thank you, Belle --
It hasn't opened yet?
No! No! I won't.
Not me! 
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Black Dan'l?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
She couldn't be gone!
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Where's everybody?
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
He was --
My time isn't up yet.
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Not long -- now.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Worried!
Jabez --
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
Let him try it.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Of course not --
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I want someone to talk to ...
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Married.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
It's okay, it's okay.
But meant her moving here.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
I'm going to count to three...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
They're not after you, they're after me.
How are you doing?
I'm really shakey.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Look... who's on the phone?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You try calling the police?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
Who's this?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
You alone, or you got confederates?
What do you want to know that for?
Call me Sonny-boy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Come on, lemme load you up...
If you take anybody, please take me.
You like me?
I'm sorry.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Are you a lawyer?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
It was on the TV.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.
Get 'em in the vault!
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
What?
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
All right ... let's go.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Yeah ...
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
Have him walk in backwards.
Okay, Sonny.
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
Gimme the black guy...
I speak what I feel.
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
Maybe...
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Be kind to your sitter.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Yes?
Did you ask Sal?
So, in other words, you are not down.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
I don't know how he does it.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
I hope the block is still standing.
We're still standing.
Fifty cents.
I'm going with you.
Yo, I'm gone.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Sorry, comb got caught.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Do I have to spell it out?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Christmas came early.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Do I love you?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
That's what you think?
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I love you, my brother.
Forget it, Mookie.
I like Mookie a lot.
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
'Bout time, Pop.
Don't start on me today.
Yeah, I think.
I'll tell you why!
Depends how you define 'new'...
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What? No! Look.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Wow.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Who's Captain Rob?
Peg leg?
LLOYD, she's my mom.
You take that back!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Put some ice on it.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Who?
D2.
No. Look.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Right.
Okay. Which one do you want?
So can I come along?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
You really are a pirate.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
And I you.
And, take some more pictures.
What papers?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
They said you were dead.  They said...
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
He's hiding something.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
MOTHER! Tell me!
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!
"It is my home."
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Yeah, I did.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Like <u>what</u>?!
That's right...
Did you really mean those things you said..?
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
I think you're quite handsome.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Yes?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Are you a fruit?
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Isn't he dead?
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
I am.  How's your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
My chiropractor!
Huh?!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
You don't wanna be noticed?
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
NOOOOO!!!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Who?
No.
Went --
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Good luck.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
What?
Holy sh--
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Who?
Ma...
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Who's in it?
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Leave. Go.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
Oh yeah.
Somewhere.
No... Could you?
What?
What did you do to your hair?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What?
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Yeah?!
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No. What happened?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What's the dif --
Yeah...
You brought the girl!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Ed... I'm sorry.
Do you still have it?
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Hm?
Good?
What does that have to do with... ?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Tracy.
You bet.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
That sounds good.
Take as much room as you want
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
And when did you do it?
Door was open.
Which door?
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
What...?
Well, I do.
Paul, get out!
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What's it to you?
That obvious, huh?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Yes.  But do you know?
It's Lynn.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What are you talking about?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Dudley's guys.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Susan Lefferts.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Nothing.
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
You make a mistake?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
I'll take your word for it.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Yeah.
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Yeah.  Me neither.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Clear as day.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
A direct one.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
What do you mean?
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Why?
Those are Feds.
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
You got any money?
Very good.
I'll say.
What size?
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
I'm not his attorney.
No.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Yes sir.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What do you mean?
Well, you know--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I see her for business.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Was that doctored-up, too?
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
That's okay.
Who?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
My suitcase is gone.
You're not.
Who's doing this?
I gotta go.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Bullshit.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
You have to.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
I <u>did</u> care how.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
He didn't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Brill.
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Why?
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby--
How can I reach you?
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
Hiding something?
Sir--
I just meant--
We don't know.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Yes sir.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Excuse me?
I don't care to bargain.
Shall we be all right?
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Will you please come in?
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
What do you hate most?
You bastard, I was believing you!
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Shall we be all right?
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
What?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
In my room.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I don't know.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Rabbit hunting.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Who are his ghosts?
Please don't creep around this house.
I liberated it.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
What did you say?
The rest meant nothing to me.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Well, she is!
Aren't you?
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Yes?
Why?  Is he staying?
I don't think it's indifference.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
Hana, I know you do!
I love you.
Is something funny?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
Yes, for your hair.
I follow the wires.
No. But he hands them over.
You loved him.
I try not to expect you.
I mean home.  India.
So one day we'll meet.
No.  He's - no.
A toddler
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I was looking forward to this evening.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
I'll come with you.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What are you talking about?
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Too late now.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
I sincerely hope so.
It's not for sale.
Oh?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Possibly.
Not funny.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Our equipment has arrived.
It was a long time ago.
Yes you did.
A dozen times.
Charged. Receiver?
Terrified. Still am.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You can't be too careful.
What?
It's your mistake.
The big job.
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
I'd taken the Mask?
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
You can do it.
Get out of here!
My god--
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
You are a miracle worker.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
You know where my loyalties lie.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yes?
Right.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
Yeah.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
No one's taking anything --
So why would PG&E offer it?
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Well I hate it.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Better safe than sorry.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
Lock the door.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
More than you need me.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
No ... there is another.
Ben ... Ben ...
Right.
What's wrong with him?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
It can wait.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I'm against that.
Beautiful.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Yes, you do.
That's quite a compliment.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Thanks to you.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
What have you done to my ship?
Hyperdrive.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Thanks.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
We have no use for your kind.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
I thought you knew this person.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
He'll survive.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I see a city in the clouds.
And I too.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
That primitive apes can talk.
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
It's so good to see you again.
What's in it for me?
Not anymore.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
What's the little black box do?
Call me Snake.
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
...I saw nothing.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Move aside!
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Rise, Mordred.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
You freed it, son?
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Who?!
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Love demands it.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
I'm sorry.
Just five or six people.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
I can't believe it.
What is it?
Really? wow.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Fine thank you.
Yes, I think so.
Depression?
Never.
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Why, I don't understand?
You could do it yourself...
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Are you sure?
You like it?
Here I'll show you.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
How's the girl?
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
It would bring us together.
Ego te abslovo.
Who are you?
How's your leg?
Last month.
But deliver us from the evil one.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
I've seen him.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No I probably wouldn't.
Very much.
Who?
Yes?
Yes
How old are you?
Who is it?
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
It's our goddamn car!
What about tomorrow?
It's all there.  Both nights.
Swimming trunks.
You bring trunks, Jack?
How many?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
You got weird kids, Frank.
You look awful.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
What're you talking about?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
You're getting cold feet about this.
Get out of here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Unless you want the right.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Yeah.  You mind?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
What?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Couple years.
April.
You always threw up.
He was just having fun.
You don't know?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
What're you doing?
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Sure.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Good choice.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
So what'd you think?
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Yes, it is.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's your dress?
What's wrong with it?
A seven.
Uh... good.
They're nines.
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Yeah.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Huh?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
Gotta go.
How come?
Thanks.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
Baker.
Right.  In there.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah.
His kid's sick.
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
You want me to walk you?
Forget it.
I'm not upset.
You were good.
Who's Nina?
Sure.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
He's got blood in his eye.
Is that what you used to do?
How do you know?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
My place.
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
So you had a nightmare.
How come?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
What more proof do you need?
Eve ...
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
No problem.
I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
I think I could figure it out.
Got it.  Good tip.
Ah. A classic...
Great room...
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
How much time?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Uh huh...
Okay, chief.
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Yeah...fine.
Because youll be here.
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Now...I dont...
A perk for what?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.
To Paris. Paris, France.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
No...Im not...
So we'll get egg nog.
This makes five.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Reed? ... Sue?
Give me the god damn mirror!
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
I'm worried about you.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
What about you?
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
Ben, are you there?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Sweet.
Then what is it?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
It's been changed.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Passion.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
If it happened to him, then it could...
What in the world would give me that idea?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
I know that. But what's the maximum?
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
We're pushing oxygen today.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
A long time, with one man.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
A surgeon might...
That's what they pay me for.
What gives you that idea?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
That's right. And we need more money.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Yah.
Ya got that right.
White Bear Lake?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
You're not a C student.
Uhn.
Uh-huh.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Hold on.
Yah, right -
Yah!
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Yah, but -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
No, see -
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Oh, yah?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Yah?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, that's me.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I always liked ya so much...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
...Mike Yanagita!
No.
Yah.
- looking.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Norm, that's terrific!
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
No, I wasn't aware...
Dynamite?
You need to lighten up.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
So you're staying in tonight?
Worth every penny.
It suits you.
Please.
No, thanks.
Here.
I wish I could return the favor.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
What?
Tyler?
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
No, supply oxygen?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
This is how we fill up our lives.
And, now it's gone.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Like hell.  That counted.
Is it?
The fight.
Same here.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Show-off.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
A liposuction clinic.
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
Work.  Going to work.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
I'm going to...
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
What?
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Noooo, please...
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Really?
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
I hope you're ready for this.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Speed up.
We need to hurry.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
May we come in?
She did.
I wasn't worried about us.
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, honey.  I just --
I mean it.  Take care of it.
"It?"
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Right. April 25th.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
I know who you are.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
That's what I'm doin'!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Start over.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
What's that?
I thought he was with you.
Let's go.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
That's an order.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
He... took it.
Nice work.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
Those men are all dead.
What did you want?
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
Yeah.
Well did you or didn't you?
No, thank you.
What?
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
No... it's just...
No.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Fine.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Huh-huh.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
No... thanks... Listen --
A quest?
They work for Him.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You really want to help me?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
It's a classic.
In a bar called Hellfire.
What are the other reasons?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well, it's enough for me.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Serveza yourself!
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Do you love me, Bobby?
Is what you?
You got any change?
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Five'll do it.
Hi, Tita.
I know.
A couple of months.
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Yes, intentionally.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Tomorrow, then.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I don't think that's accurate...
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Just give me a chance, will you?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
It's all right. I'm fine.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Besides being very rude.
You better hold onto your tongue!
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
What are you doin' here?
No.  What you do today?
I just wanted to see you.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I did.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
Yeah.
Yo, that's my girl.
Your friend must be misinformed.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Wonder who his supplier is.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I think Id rather have drugs.
Fletch...
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Wait a second --
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
They bust you every week.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Because we can't.
Charmed.
Come inside.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
You doing a story on this guy?
You've met her?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
No. He was. I got him out.
Depends on the question.
Good point.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
That's what I want to know.
You saw a forgery.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I think you better sit down.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Not really.
Not really?
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Oh... I have some questions.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Thanks, I needed that.
You're saying you need money.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Wha --
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Why have you come to my planet?
Twelve pack?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
And hey, I appreciate it...
Yeah, go on...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
That's cute.  You're funny.
Hey, the poet...
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Cause if I do.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
No... yeah...
Man, I'm clean.
I wasn't looking.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
But will they?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What?
You're for real?
He got off on six.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Who's on him?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
We put him to bed for the night.
Third time around.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Whatta you got?
Just for mistakes of parking?
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You know what I'm saying.
Nothing.
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I seem nervous, huh?
You alright?
Sure.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
How's that?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Wait...
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Oh, that was my kid.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Sun spot?
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
What?
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
You really wanna know?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
H-hi.
I'm right here, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Go in where?
My father didn't die in a fire?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
A hot shot, huh?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Gulp!
We're gonna scare him?!
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
I wish it was.
Sheriff, you better take this.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Are they grown-ups?
There's no time for this bullshit...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Eight times.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Skin stretcher was human.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Okay, I'll call you later.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
So's he and he knows it.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
She's yours?
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Next, you dial a number.
Oh my God, Steven.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Until I hear the truth.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
No.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
The fire alarm...
Perfectly.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Oh dear God...
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I'm staying.
You can and you will!!
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Yes...
We changed our minds.
I'd love to.
Elliot?
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Don't talk like that.
But didn't we know it would happen?
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
You say we go?
Where is it?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Can he get through it?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
He will absolutely hate it.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Packs an emotional wallop.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Yes.
See, Daddy.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
And you've been extremely patient.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I don't know if I can say that.
Pop, will you let me in?
It's me. Nicky.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Get yourself something to eat.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
You're charming the boy.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
They're my team.
What about my play?
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
Yes, Peter.
Burnt sienna.
Yes.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
So do I. Over and over.
Is it true?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Everyone takes his turn.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
I thought you were against fighting.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'll take care of it.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Six one.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
You wish.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Any particular reason?
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Is that all?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Antonio, the choir...
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Why not?
Why don't we say we were together?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Whisky and a peach.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'm still here, Doc.
I bought you a lot of new things.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Do it my way.
Do it my way.
And switched keys.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I don't see how.
I'll be ready.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
I don't know, airport I guess.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
All right. Shells?
Chicago.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Can't leave the desk.
You got it.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
Can he trust you?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Yes.
How?
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
How'd it happen, then?
What about?
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Why?
Jack, you're wrong.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Yes you can.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Really?
And what was that?
What girl?
And you didn't know her last name?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
I left last year.
What?
That's what I was wondering.
Nobody seems to know.
Yes.
Right.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Las Vegas.
Who's Brumby?
Yeah.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
They came back?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Can't say I do.
Yes.
You're not seeing me?
No.
I'm not?
I...I don't know.
I...
No.
Eh...?
Who?
He's doing very well.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
You build it!
That's what I...
Yes...?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
As an idea.
Talking about it as a...
Is that what I said?
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
You...
Yes.
What does that mean?
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
It's a waste of time.
They stole the...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
To the cops?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
The people downtown said...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Shelly, you blew the last...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
What about the other two?
What two?
Not lately it isn't.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
What if you don't close...?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
And fifty bucks a lead.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Now.  Yes...When?
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't do it, Shelly...
The leads are coming.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Mmm.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Guess who?
Yes.
Which...
Home...
No, his wife is.
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Lingk.  James Lingk.
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
Why did she do that, Jim?
I don't understand.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
We'll speak to her, Jim...
What power?
You going to turn State's?
You did that?
They got, listen to me...
The...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
John...
On your pillow.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Oh yes, the very best.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
I got surprises for everybody!
Bought at the airport.
Tom is right.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
 You're a good fellow.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.
Wait'll you see!
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Why?
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
He's not the same as when I met him.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
What was it, so I'll know.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
They are everywhere!
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Thanks...friend.
Very well.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Yes, Michael.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Why too late?
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Right here.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Not good.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
We worked it all out beforehand.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
What if I say shove it?
How much more a month?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Well...no, not really --
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What do I do?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
And your name is --?
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
No.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
Cut it out!
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
No.  Definitely not.
Do I have any other choice?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
I didn't have the guts for it.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What'd you say?
I don't know.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Need some help?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
She is beautiful.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Tell me about Kip -
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
You betcha --
Where you been, anyway?
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Remember who my brother is?
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
He's in some trouble ...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
What?
Come here -
I gotta get my tool --
Hospital.
That's what I want ...
Okay.
Now... I'm in ...
What about The Club ... ?
She left...
She soars -
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
Not --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Anybody!  You understand?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Get inside!
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
What are you talking about?
You what?
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Paulie was just talking about him.
We did it.  We did it.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
How?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
No, no. It's okay.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
I hate to do dishes.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
I don't want them left back.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
How you doin'?
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Yah, all right...
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
I told you "no" yesterday!
Why don't you beat off at your house?
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
And what do you see?
What're those?
Of course.
--Half-red, half-black--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I'm pretty sure it's right.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
It's Saturday.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I've been busy.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Why would he do that?
Who?
"Undermine?"
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't have any anger at you--
Why there?
I got one of those too.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
That's very presumptuous.
How about the ones on that shelf?
285.
No.
What is?
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
Well, are you going out again?
Hence, the word remarried.
Why not?
When did you know she was the one?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Yeah, I think so.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Here's my number.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Sure.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
Not a chance.
Do you know all their names?
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
Exactly.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
I want you to come with me.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Why not?
Then what are you afraid of?
What am I scared of?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
I never knowed they was anything like her!
How 'bout you?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
People done it. If they could, we could.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
How many men?
Four.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
I ain't gonna run.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Women is always tar'd.
But we can still do it, honey.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Yeah.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Yes, ma'am.
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
No--an' look what I got for you.
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
That's right. And douse some in it.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
Looks like you done it.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Won't they ketch us?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
I never--
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yeah...
It's what I do.
Wonderful.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
It's nice to see you again.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Well, there's not much to tell.
You met people.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
--She's not dead---
Not the other way around...?
Get the fuck outta here.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Jesus Christ!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
You know where I live?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
You understand the psychology of the job.
Okay.
Up on the right.
Like a union?
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
Hey, Bob.
In Portugal, yes.
Wait a minute--
You're wrong. Look at his face.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Yeah...
Paul?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I thought you lived in Chicago?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Exactly...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay.
Why did you go?
What did he say?
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Good night.
Everything all right.
I wish I did.
You're allergic to hay.
Let's not talk about that now.
No. He had the choice.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
What was it like?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
That's what some folks say.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I wouldn't let happen.
You know, you're a good kid.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
What does that mean?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
So?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I know. Amazing.
We still have a way to go.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Don't move!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
The sensitive type.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
What are you doing?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Think you can do better?
I'm Crash Override.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll make it up to you!
How?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
I think we've got something.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Hey, it's me.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Michael Myers.
Look.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Outside.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Who you calling?
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
I don't want to.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Just do it.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Don't you mean what you do best?
You won't look pushy.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
It isn't a man.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Don't touch him Jamie!
What?
You blame everything on kids.
We just talked.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Thanks.
What's this big, big news?
Is that all you say?
Michael's around someplace...
I'll be here.
They may be right.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Promise?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
What does that mean?
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
Mmm?
Are you really interested?
Great.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
What?
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Uh-huh.
...with the affiliates.
I don't know exactly.
Ohhhh!
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No!  No...
How-how's Frederick?
Well, sure.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Oh, right.
What are you doing?!
What do you expect me to say?
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, my God.
No.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
It's on the table, Dad.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Yeah.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
It was on your shirt!
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
He's fine.
I know, I know.
Well, then a third opinion.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
She really does, though.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Easily.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
What's the matter?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Oh, so loosely.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
No!
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I recall you.
How are you?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
No, you can tell me.
You have.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're kidding me.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
They're offering... 
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
...you...
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
That would adversely impact my income.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
...nightmare.
They got that kind of money?
...what a world.
Seen what, sir..?
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...what's he got against you?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
You nervous...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
...should love to correct your error. 
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I'll have them picked up.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
...yes, yes, yes...
We got KittyKat...
...tell them...
Sir, with all due respect....
You were given backup....
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
And how did he do that?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Don't shoot yourself.
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
...<u>what</u>...?
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
...what do you expect me to...
Then we cannot go.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Hey, lost again.
Or clear your windshield with it.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
...yes, yes, yes....
Then tell me.
....that's right.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
For approval.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
What is your point?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Did you wait until you were 18?
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
You are the prince of the darkness.
I hope so...
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
That would be a No.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
So what?                                                    ]
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Probably.
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
"Wichita"--The guy every boy wants                          ] to be and every girl wants to hold.                         ] You're the love of my life and the                          ] end of the world. Cheers.                                   ]
Ronnie!
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
You're beautiful.
All right.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Uh-huh.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
How very.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
And your worst enemy.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
French.
Incredible similarity.
Did not.
No-o!
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Superb.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Get a job.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Thank you so much!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
What???
You're such an incredible woman.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
All right, then.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
The way you just looked at me...
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
What?
Yeah, how's that?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
What's that?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where's my wife?
We're all here for you Trevor.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
Well now there's a compliment.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Lie, you mean...
Were you in it?  In the war?
What picture?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
You do?
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
So this really does the trick, eh?
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
What toys do you have?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
I understand that.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Who doesn't?
Oh, that's fine.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Holly -- that's not so.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
That's okay, Mom.
What's that?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
And it's a shorter commute.
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
No.
All new houses have noises.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Look, I think we should work things out.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Isn't it?
Put it out, man!
The thermometer's broken.
Promise.
Uh huh.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
I'd like you to see this.
What?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Who are you?
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
Sing.
I hear you.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
If it came down to it what would you do?
Me?  Of course.
You.
She's a treasure she is.
How?
Why not?
I cannot explain.
Are you a cop?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
New York is dangerous place.
Sorry.
I've lived all over the world.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
You don't really believe this do you?
How did you know that?
Conner?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
Why?
I like my work.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
No.  The money, please.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
I guess not.
Bullshit!
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
It's about Mars --
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
They're fine.
How about the cop?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
We're trapped in a house.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
I overheard him with the girl.
I don't know.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
What do you mean?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Mine, too.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Where are they?
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
What's wrong with the radio?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Yes, sir.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
And what will they do with these satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I committed no war crimes.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
What is it?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Of course.
For supplies, you drive.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Our cards, please.
You have our cards.
Of course.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Let's have dinner first.
Homework?
What?
We must do something.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
C'mon.
-- I'm sure you did.
-- fuck you!
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
What?
Up here --
Prove it.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Don't push it.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Let's try down here...
He's gotta still be down here.
We're safe?
-- was that??
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then who are they?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
And here's your goddamn severance!
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I can't remember at the moment.
I am.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
The lockdown thing.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
What's the matter?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Well then who did?!
She talks to me.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
For good luck honey.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Must be...
Oh come on...
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
The amulet...
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
That is the story of my life.
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Then tell me what to do.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
So where is it?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
Oh yeah ...
What is it?
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
And he still sits there?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
I don't know.  Maybe.
Uh-huh.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Fuck you!
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
You sound disappointed.
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Get em....
Ooh-kay...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Prison?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Trust Leonardo....
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
You certainly do.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Shucks.  Guess not.
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Hipster!
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm plenty happy!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
I'm sure I --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Every year?
Now, Aim --
Consider this my resignation --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Phony, huh?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
I filed it yesterday.
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
Watch it, Archer --
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
But, buddy --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Sir?
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
-- tough titty toenails!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Not even behind your back?
Oh my God, sir!
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Maybe he's wise.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
I'm afraid so.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
But, Mrs. Rand --
Thank you.
But it's so far away...
My brother's wife.
Mr. Holland?
It's my day off.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Did you hear what he sang?
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
I've never given it much thought.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I love Fort Holland.
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
I hated her.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Investigation of what?
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
That one.
See for yourself.
No advice from the experts, huh?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Damn it, Ben --
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Yeah.
Ben--
Yeah?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
In a bit.
Right. Gotcha.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
It was all junk!
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Let me.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
How'd you know?
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Moisture! Moisture!
You going to tell dad?
No one.
You like him? He worships you.
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
What time is it?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Twelve years younger.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What I saw?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
How do you mean?
He's asking everybody questions.
Huh?
The other guy?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Oh?
Yes down at the station.
I was a mentor to her.
But we work so well together...
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
We want no quarrel with him.
Then I leave too.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
We can do that?
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
No.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
He'll never let us go.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
What danger?
Love?
But if she dies...
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
NO!!!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yes.
They never found the body.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Yeah.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
You know me to well.
You sure?
You don't seem fine.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
Are you sure?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
I trusted you.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Why?
Hello?
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
But why?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Sleep well.
I think not.
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Poor Cathy --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I don't know now without my father.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
They shall not hurt you
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
Really, this is idiotic!
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Her family name?
What is her illness?
Hero?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
You are my friend.
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Angel, Second Class.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Where's Mary?
Yes, but George . . .
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
All right.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Uh-huh.
All in . . .
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Anything I can do back here?
Yes  charge.
Aw, get going!
Oh, it's wonderful.
No. No.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Hello, what am I bid?
Where are you going?
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
George . . .
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Five hundred dollars.
I'll take chocolate.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
In that place?
How's that?
Didn't you tell her?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Tuesday.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Thank you.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Yeah, just started.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Someone pop your balloon?
I think we're changing course a little.
Back down!
No.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
There's a shark....
Over here!
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
You heard me.
Yeah?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Too late, it's written.
My ass!
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
What shark?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Okay, so that's it.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound?
In the den.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Damn.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
It's all right, we're okay.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Great.
Okay, okay, coming....
Nope.
Me neither.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Shut up.
Just like this.
Figure they split?
What the hell is it?
I can go out if I want to.
When are we going out?  You and me?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Forget it, he won't listen.
Go on, you're tired.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
How many sharks have you killed?
Yeah.
Get out of here!
Are you scared?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Don't think about it.  It's over.
It's too soon to move him.
Like hell!
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
And I like you.
She, Mister Hutton.
And big for his age.
Massachussettans aren't.
I'm a water-skier.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
How come?
And alone.
I don't know, what else is there?
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
SEAN!
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
That's what grandmas are for.
Don't bother Hoagie....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Yes, I did.
It sure is....
I have work....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Spent it all on beer....
You have something to say about everything....
That....
I'm not doing anything.
What's going on?
It's too dangerous....
You're silly....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
You could teach...You could....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Where do I pull off...?
No!
What?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
My vision is perfect....
I do....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
We'll pass around cigars....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Who?
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
'A Moray eel....'
Don't flatter yourself.... 
I told you....
Anything to do before I go home?
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
Because, don't get into it ...
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Car accident.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
No.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
No, it has a mind of its own.
No.
What color was it?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
Of course I would ..
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
It's not possible right now.
Why?
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
You do?
Why?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Freddy's new obsession ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I know about the bachelor party.
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Absolutely.
Hi.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Right.  I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Oh hell yes.
Will you marry me?
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't know --
Of course, medical! _ 42.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
No--
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Okay.
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Great word.  Towel?
Fine.
No, I don't know.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
No.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Why not --
I think so.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Don't be silly.
Pleasure.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
He's this way.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
What did you think?
We need to head for the coast.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
But you never came across just one.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
I don't believe you.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
I don't even know this woman.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
That was about a year ago.
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Isn't it obvious?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
Piss.
You're going too?
What are they?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
I'm her father.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
The door security systems are shutting down.
What now?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Shhhhh!
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
They died together?
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The fences are electrified, right?
No, no, no!
Alan!
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Why not?
What are we looking for?
Are they heavy?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
"Thunder lizard!"
You got me.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Relatively.
For today, I guarantee it.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
All night?
Yes.
John, John.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Who?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
He wets the bed?
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Insomnolesence...
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Great.	When can you do it?
You're not going to be there?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
About ten minutes.
What is it really?
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What an extraordinary request!
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Sit down, Kafka.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Well, I --
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
They're not obliged to tell.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
... Just a perception.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
-- Just doing our job.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
What's to become of us now?
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
No!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Jack!...  Jack!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
That's too bad.
Yes -- all right --
-- Yes.
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
Yes.
Will you let me go then?
You said that.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Most of them.
OK.
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
Is there anything more I could --
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
No.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
My bed.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
What?
With Trina.
Trask wants to talk with you.
You're going back?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right.
I've just got a few --
She told me.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Yes sir, we know he --
Yes?
Detroit.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Show...
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Uh huh?
Oh...
It's my name too.
You like it?
Uh huh...
No.
Uh, huh?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
What else wasn't there?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Six years.
And yet you chose to leave him?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You have?
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Ted, do you love him?
Beautiful.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Are you firing me, Jim?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Six.
Ten.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Look, Ted, all I--
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
You and Charley?
A moment.
Again?
No.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
I have.
Did you receive the letter?
Yes.
Two.
No. Not very big.
America, we shall see.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Thank you.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
You will always!
I have smarter men.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Completely.
It is a difficult situation.
Much too young.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
This could end up saving your life,--
No crocodile has ever--
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Hey!!
I never had sex with you!
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
No.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
I <u>told</u> you.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
I beg your pardon?
You flew up here because your boss--
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
I heard something.
I'm not mushing it.
You calm down!
You wanna ride in my truck?
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Other than to eat us?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
<u>We</u>?
Gee.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
What is this?
Yes.
He said he knew Karate!
Kevin, hey.
It's ten after nine.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I want you to go there.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Backstabber?
Myra.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Get me out!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I understand.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Not yet.
Murdered...? How?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Why not?
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
May I see your credentials?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
Maybe they'll catch up.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Then please - do this test for me.
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Mmm. And what else...?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
On what basis would they reject him?
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes. I'll tell you.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
We leave in the morning?!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
How did you learn English?
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Yes. Yes, I will.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Sir!
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
For Munro children?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
France.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Be my guest.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Was there such a thing?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
That's an order!
Shit...
What?
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Has it helped?
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
What's your air reading?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Russian.
...and a Russian grandmother...
Who cares?
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
And Tom took care of them.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Er well, yes we do.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
OK, open the gate.
How about you? All right?
Plank?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
Why, what's up?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
You will what?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Er, well, twelve.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
You think I can't learn that?
Yes, sir--
I am, sir.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Chaos.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
He'll live.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
A .45--
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Do I seem jumpy?
Best part of the job.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
If it's too late--
Come on in.
I never met her.
He a Black man or an Indian?
You know who I am?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Made some money, came back here--
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
Yeah. I bet he would.
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
You go by your old house?
He still living?
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You ever play one of these?
And my father?
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
Enough with the clothes--
How much you got left?
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
Want to take a walk?
Yeah.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
More, I hope.
Like your story is over.
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
They got telephones.
Oh.
You'd do a good job.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
They go together.
Why?
D'Amour.
Right.
What about death?
You'll do more.than that.
It's him... it's him.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
Why not?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Some or it.
I wasn't.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
I'm here, Harry.
I... have... to.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'd like to hear them.
Mr. D'Amour?
Mine.
I saw him in Vegas once.
I don't think the dead much care.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Have you been in?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Or murdered, like Nix.
It's me betrayed him.
No.
Yes.
Looks that way.
He's better off this way.
Fuck.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
And he's dead?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
You'll do it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
No, we'll find something around here.
Hi, Bob.
Yes?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
Hi, Lydia.
Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Do you want I send it to your room?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Uh...sure...I...what?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  What are they?
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
What time did you make it for?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
My secretary?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Just open the door, please.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter Kelson?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I had to.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What about after?
Whish the circumstances were different.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
He can see you Thursday.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Nothing.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
To that stewardess?
Whatever.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
But you use potato?
This time get your feet set.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
No.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
I was just showing emotion.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just wanted to say good game.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
How's that been?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
He works at a bank.
Okay.
A ride home.
Please.
Big-ass titties?
And?
So she's honest.
Your hot-ass temper.
You either.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Figures.
That what you think?
You sure?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not asking for us to be together.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Uh huh.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Getting there.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
For what?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
We were just studying.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
I'm fine.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Still is, so let yourself out.
And some things should never fucking happen!
What?
After five years.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Don't sit down.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, but I don't know --
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yeah.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Eight o'clock?
You wanna make a deal with me?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What?
ok.
Yeah.
just let me walk out, ok?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
I was listening --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Do you have love in your heart?
Might of been before my time.
What?
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
You see?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Go fuck myself?
Who?
Jack.
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
No.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
No.
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
-- just to clarify --
This isn't meant --
Yes.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Go ahead and waste your time.
And that's what you've heard?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
the valley?
Are you close?
And "Frank?"
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
I AM CALM.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
No.
I didn't hear anything.
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
-- did she talk to you?
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Just once.
Are you her boyfriend?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Partridge?
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
yeah.
Do you have that?
That's it.
That's pretty cool.
You're late, not me.
I didn't know the answer --
I said I'm fine.
Yes.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
....Why does he do it...?
...what...?
M'lady...?
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Tomorrow.
More wine!!
But -- what is he doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
To the Bastille.  And death.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
You can't do it.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Why didn't you say so?
Come on...
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Athos, my friend!
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Your mother's.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Exactly why it should be given away.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
My dear, I've already done it.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Yeah?
Where are you?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Fine -
What?
And who are you?
I'll live...
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
He said he was following up some lead.
No, but I'm listening.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Both at the same bank...
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
County jail - get in.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
I don't recommend it.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
How much do you know?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
These are all dead, Will.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I won't be here.
That's narrow?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
What?
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Don't talk to me!!
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
You'll let me go now?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
He's right-handed.
He's misunderstood.
'Intimate? !"
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
We have it good, don't we?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Me, too. And very erotic...
To do what?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Thanks.
Go on to the house.
Yes. Who are you?
Yeah...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Yes.
We don't know that.
How did it happen?
She got all right?
Stuart is fine.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Pray tell.
Pictures?
Why does it feel good?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Kevlar Second Chance.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
That's alright.  Where...?
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Tony Clifton.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I used to think you were original.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
There!
Yes.
It's my name.
Know what?
Oh shit.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
He had an accident.
You killed them.
The Matrix isn't real!
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Go.
Yes.  Now.
But what if...?
What do you know?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
What truth?
Far from it.
When?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
But what?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Because...
Not yet.
It's a city?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
No, she isn't.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
That's not going to help.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Mind your own business.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Let's go to the movies...on you.
What did he do?
Teresa.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Maybe, who knows.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Yeah, so things'll be even.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You what?
But it's your birthday.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Of course.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Right away.
Hi.
Am I not obligated to?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
No no, not you.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
'Just kidding'?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Sure.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Well, that's very interesting.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
My Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
Yes?
Thanks.
Confused, huh?  About what?
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Be sorry for nothing.
Gay?
No.
-- I guess you haven't.
-- Yes?
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Not at all.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
That's what everybody says.
I don't understand.
Oh.  Okay.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Well...I don't know.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I guess...
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
That's okay.
This universe?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Are you threatening me?
He is --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
That's me.
It just occurred to me --
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
Time.
Watch it!
The 'question' --
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Drew told me.
I am.  With you.
What were you going to say?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
I'm sorry.
Daddy --
The fireworks are about to start.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing lasts.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
But we've got time.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Couple days.
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
Leonard.
Hi, Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Do you remember me?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Take the money and walk away!
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Yes.
Why?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What?
Your wife?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
What are you gonna do?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Don't protect him.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Dying.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
I don't know.
Thank you.
Teddy!
I guess I've told you about my condition.
Mr Gammell?
Probably left it in your room.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
What sort of questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
You can't just take it!
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Lemon or lime?
Grieve elsewhere.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Tell them what you want.
Yes you do...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Make it 35.
When?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Where's she now?
I insist.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What's the best fortune you ever got?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Why?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Of course.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Detective Crockett.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
To recruit you.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo...!
He did volunteer one time...
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Alonzo...
You sure you heard what I said?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
I show you what problem --
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Oh hell, forget it.
Forget it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
You like it? Take a look.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
Sounds like they knew you.
What?
Yessir, I can see that.
Ready for hard work, son?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Ziat!
I know.
How far?
Not far. Just a little way.
Yes.  I think so.
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Hello.
Thank you.
Billy!  Please!
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
What?  You gotta be joking.
Oh we... we...
Lady...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Oh, man, there you go again.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
You did!
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
No such thing, baby.
Susan, we're not b-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Toss the flare down!
How?!
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
I can.  We can do this...
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Will I be able to walk?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Misery?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
The Sistine Chapel?
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Yes.
I don't know.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Yeah, yeah...
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
It will.
You don't know?
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
What? What is it?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
That's nice.
What thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Yes, he is.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Maybe you can, Libby.
Buster.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
No, the typing kind.
You're still a writer.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
And my room?
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
What else?
To do what?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
I am. She is.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Listen to what?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
And that's the only reason?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Much.
I've no doubt.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Twice.
Not necessarily.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
I don't.  No exactly.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
What?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
We did what we had to do.
I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
Whos dead?
One hour.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Information.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
That depends.
On what?
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Where exactly is it?
My contact is extremely shy.
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No.  Abort.
- and picked us up in the States -
Good luck.
Keep counting Claire.
Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
I think I might just take that look.
Its not working.
The Shawfish?
Very good.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
What killed him?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
You have too many dogs.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
Loretta.
I don't know.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
No.
What are you doing!
Stop it!
Me neither.
What about Johnny?
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
I'll come to the wedding.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Thank you.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
How can you ask me that?
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Ronny, please...
You? No.
No?
She was too young for him.
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yes, on the floor.
Seven-thirty.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Yeah.
We should talk alone.
If I marry you my mother will die.
No. He don't.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
He's with his dying mother!
It was a miracle.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
You should think about this.
Come on in.
It's late.
I don't know.
No idea.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
But absolutely!
Do you have a girlfriend?
It's nothing!
Then why are you eating alone?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Good night.
What? What?
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Yes!
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
None shall pass.
Come on you pansy!
Come on then.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I'm invincible!
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
A G...g...g...
A Grail?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Be quiet!
Blue.
Yes he is.
Thursday.
Is it?
Leaving the room ... yes.
Is that clear?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Sir Galahad!!
Camelot ...
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I didn't.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Sixty.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
Louder, girl!
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
By whose authority?
You'll talk when I'm finished!
Who'll bring it to me?
Yes.  I do.
It can wait.  Anything else?
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
It's nothing.
Surely --
Why?
They aren't as watchful as you.
In time, she will.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Archie.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
Yes, ma'am?
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Unwell?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
Funny.
So how did it know my name, then?
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
It's already out.
The Police, then...
And beat it at it's own game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
No I'm not...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
What?
You've got the schematics, check.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Check your read-out.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
So how do I start?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
What did you say?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
And?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
It's been a very strange day.
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Was anyone hurt?
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I think I've been hurt.
Oh...
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
No.... I don't...
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Not that I can see.
Okay.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Is this really the time ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I don't help criminals.
Got it.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Son, let's watch the tape.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
I was.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Aren't you the bitter one.
I'll see that bet.
You're paying the bills.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you writing a poem?
I don't think you're very polite.
I don't even know your name.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Me, I'll know!
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Was it a nice funeral?
Of course.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You are?
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
I guess you have.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Give it back Nicholas!
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
TAXI!!!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Change my name.
And I thought I was weird.
Come and get it.
Ten bucks.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Phil for God sake.
Oh...what's that?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Excuse me?
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
Something wrong?
Well I'm sort of involved.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
You leave your father to me.
He's so tiny.
O.K.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Pardon?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Yeah.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Okay, sure.
Here?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Want to what?
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
I'll second that.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Hand me the canula.
Then who's it for?
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Dad??
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
What are you doing.
Yes.
There were just too many of 'em.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Thank you. Bye.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Uh huh.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Aarrggh.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Okay, get in to bed.
Goodnight.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
What's wrong with your eyes?
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
I am running faster!!
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay on the count of three.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
... weeks.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
Ben Gay.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
And the answer was so simple.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Exactly what?
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
... Thomas, yeh.
W...
Such as.
My very point.  Here's another one...
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
Have you.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
No.
What's wrong honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
What's wrong with her.
Bye, Bye.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Whose word?
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
You know better than that.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Let me know when you do, all right?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
He is just wonderful.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
What kind?
What year?
Sixty-three.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
When I was little, in church.
Well, can you tell me why?
About three years.
And before?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes. Who's this?
Wow!
Wrong.
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
What...?  0h, yes.
They said go see the chaplain.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
I'll be there.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Yes.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
You go to school together?
He is to a lot of people.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Is that good?
Sure thing.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
You've heard of it?
Anything.
Look, I'll trade you.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Yes.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Yes.
I do, too.
That's the way of the world.
Capt'n!
Wayne---
Scotty?
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They're mesmerising.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
No.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
No thanks.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
That's the way he is.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
What about that girl?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Yeah, that's so.
Am I as good as they?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
We'll be all right.
How come you keep askin'?
They won't.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
What're you going to do?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
How 'bout the key?
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
Better get him to a hospital.
It ain't in me.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
He's my son!
I'm fine.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Very well.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Yeah. That was me.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
All things possible in Babylon.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
What?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Why should I want to meet him.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Almost two days.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Too late?
I know you have. C'mere.
What?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Very romantic.
Hidden camera.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Five-- Six--
Uhh, no.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
You said that already.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Little known fact.
Thanks. And what are -
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Oh I don't think so.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Duh.

Barrel.
Yes.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Why not?
He stayed a long time.
We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Yeah, why?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Who?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What do you mean?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I can't!
Hi.
'Morning, honey.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
You're going out?
First door up the stairs.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Jennifer --
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't know.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
With Hypnocyl?
We're gonna try.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Anything?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Uh, fourteen.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Night, night, Honey.
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm an actress.
Hello.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
If that's all right.
Okay.
Okay.
I was.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
She saw through me.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Why?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Well done you.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
You disappeared.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Christ, what is going on in there?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ahm... Bernie.
Yes?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
That's not fair.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
... can't let you through.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Sort of.
And she's in your house.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Just take my work for it.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Three.
Yes.
What?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Would you like to start?
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Who? Tell me!
Yes, ma'am...
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
I hope everything is settled.
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Thank you, ma'am...
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Shhh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Ca-na-da...
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh...
Through the ass.
My feet hurt...
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I'm not running a charity ward...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Hold it a minute.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
In what way?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
No, 'fraid not...
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I'm the next one.
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Potential assaultive.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Yes, ma'am...
Thank you.
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
No...
Except possibly that.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
That was before I found out what it was.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
So?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
NO.
What?
Nice dress.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Well.  Congratulations.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Uh huh.
Any night.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
No.  He's never asked me.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
It's still the new year...
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Only what?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Because I'm the one who's single.
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
What?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Huh?
No, why?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
And you didn't tell her?
Good strategy.
Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Thicker than water.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Don't say that!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
See! You don't understand!
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Hello, Edie.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Want to go out and have one with me?
How about another one?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I don't rate it.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Every one of 'em... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Terry...?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
But you've got to listen to me.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
But you still hold out for silence?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I don't know nothing.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
Sure... .
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
First things first.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Nolan... .
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
It would seem so, Master.
Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
The moon is almost gone!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You mean...!
You better hope there is.
Yes, sir, Master.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
You were his what, his box?
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
You at least bring the gun?
Now you're talkin'.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
Two hours.
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
Yes, she did.
You know how I felt about her.
Whatta you wanna do?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
All right, but...
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
That's funny.
Of course I am.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Who was it answered the phone?
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Why not?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
A girl.
Why not?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
To warn her about Chino.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Of course not.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
It's a big house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
Me?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
What-- when?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
How you know that?
Just a minute.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
I really gotta go.
"Hey, yourself."
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
What's there?
We've always tried to beat each other.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Well sure, Colonel --
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
What do you get for winning?
Nice to meet you, Betty.
We're all going away.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
How do you like my hair?
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Wouldn't we all.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
What happened?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Thanks.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
You're going to listen to me.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I thought you were...for a while.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
I wish she hadn't.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Is that one of your poems?
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
You think so?
All right. But this better be good.
Open it.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
What do you mean?
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
What was?
I	know what a burrito is.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Richard, take it easy.
Give me some credit, will you?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
How'd you know that?
Yes... why?
It sucked.
Just until he heals up?
Zowie.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You'll never find it in the dark.
Allright. Calm down.
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
What's that mean?!
I have AIDS.
Congratulations.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Nine.
Continue.
Thank you.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
I still am.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes. On my torso.
A good start.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Hi, Mom. It's me.
What did you say?
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Right.
Aren't you?
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
How many do you know?
Duh...
Since when?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Charles...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Audrey?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
What, you're afraid?
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
How many?
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
How much?
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
I would rather we all stay--
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Not if I'm the one.
What if you're one of five?
Nice embellishment.
So which one caught your eye?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
I apologize.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
And they fell out of the sky with you?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
That way.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Second from the left.
Taylor, you can't.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Says he can't walk.
Yeah, what is it?
Youse so fucked up man.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
Where's Elias come from?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Yeah.
No... I move faster alone. 
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
...there's nobody.
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 
He dugged his own grave.
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Not tonight.
I haven't been invited.
How long would that take?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
What did you say his name was?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Certainly not to me.
I'm different. I like it fine.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Try not talking.
From you, I like it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If I did-I don't-now.
Beer or ale, Miss?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Goodbye, Betty.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
And without much discrimination.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Doesn't answer the question.
That COULD BE TOLD.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Did I do something wrong?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
That's not enough.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Oh nothing.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
How about Magruder?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
But you still think she's innocent.
Not too far, I hope.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Why should I mind?
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
What a shame.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
How nice.
I haven't really thought about it.
To the Fleet.
You approve!
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Fuck off.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Promise?
No.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
I say when it's over!
SHIT!!
Sir?
Zero distortion, sir.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
That's the point, isn't it?
What that?
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Right here, partner.
Got it.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
They took a left at the next light!
You sure?!
NOOO!!
Catch of the day.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Warm them up.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Like the old days, Dillon.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
What?
How?
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
That's ridiculous.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
It pays.
You're joking.
Why?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
You're forgiven.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Television?
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
You did.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
I more than liked it.
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It was good.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
The young lady staying in your room?
No.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
You're being ridiculous.
All this because of that whore!
He's not gonna want us.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
You're a guest here?
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Me?
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
'Scume me.
Should I be?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Who's Guilder?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Do you want me to go on with this?
As you wish...
Sire.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
No.  To the pain.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
I thought he was with you.
-- anything you want --
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Tell me.
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Have fun storming the castle.
Bye.
Your grandfather's here.
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
It's nothing ... nothing.
But that's cheating!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Coney Island??
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.  We would!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Always.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
Heil you know who!
People can hear you.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
No.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
What do you mean?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
She isn't still here, is she?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Five hundred.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
A lot?
Like what?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
What do you know about it?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Arbogast said...
You'll never find it.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Who's he?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I believe it.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Sam! No!
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
I imagine so.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Crane.
Then I'm free to go...?
Is there?
At this hour?
Satisfied with your cabin?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
What--special autopsy?
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
You--a friend to me?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Why didn't you notify the police?
That's it. You get it quick.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
Yes, the child ...
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Who'd steal her body?
Oh, is that what caused it?
How much money have you got?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
He can't hear you.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
You did.
You did miss --
What was her name?  The one I met.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
What is it, Rose?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
But I'm curious, Rose.
Don't mention it.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
But Rose...
Good night, Rose.
I said I wouldn't.
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
All right, what do you know?
Well, yeah.
Well, it's not very plain.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
What'd you say, Brother?
Let's go peep from the living room.
I can't see, let me see...
What are they doing, Doll?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Is her husband sick or something?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Got yourself up?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Yes, sir.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
I don't believe it.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Be quiet, Rose.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
... okay... you made your point.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Again.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
What do you want me to do about it?
Relax.
We should slow down.
I got him.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
The booze.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Slow down.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
It's one of a kind.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
As you wish.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
How are we doing?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Lando!
Lower it!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Proper?!
Come on! Come on!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Here goes nothing.
Oh, no.
Your father?
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
Your father he is.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Rocky!
Janet.
Yes.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh...
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Yes.
You're OK by me.
So come up to the Lab.
Goodbye
Free to try and find a game
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Morning after?
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
I think he might be worried.
I'll call your brother.
...What?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Christ.
You didn't!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
...Thanks.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Of wa?
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Why?
No dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
That's it, I'm broke.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Maybe I like garbage.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
More like thirty.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ain't they?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
What?
Looks, huh?
Let's get outta this stink.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Maybe ya better forget it.
What gaps?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
You serve martinis, doncha?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
It's all yours.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
No...
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
He's right here in the...
Eddie, come on.
That's what you woke me up for?
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
I don't work in Toontown.
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
Only time will tell.
Tempt not a desperate man!
By my heel, I care not.
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Goodnight.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Right.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Is she a Capulet?
Is that right?
What is?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
That's him.
You were a soldier, were you?
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I didn't say I was.
Bloody fucking hell...
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
He's company.
Bad company...
In here...
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Then where is it?
A means to an end, is that it?
Yeah.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
Why don't you go do better, then...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
You should learn a little patience.
To see a man about a thing.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
And what job is that?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Would you stop with that...
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I can't get enough of it.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Seven thousand...
We don't know that.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
He would have done it to us, right?
And how do you figure we do that?
Not bad enough to kill him.
It's gonna be o.k.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Then Sally comes too.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
What are you doing, Earl?
He's irresponsible.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Yeah I'm fine.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
You said that, I didn't.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Why would someone do that?
Well I just uh, you know...
We are having a sale on some items over here --
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Well you're not getting, either.
At least around here it does.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
No, I just assumed...
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's right.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
No.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Ask me if I give a shit.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
She's walking back towards the door.
She never even looked at you.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I'll give it my best shot.
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Dip me!
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Carter.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
It's called a dress.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Han?
Yes.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
We'll rub.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Yeah.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
And you defending her?
Oh, please!
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
You'll answer my questions?
We'll see.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You afraid to try?
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
No.  You take it.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Excuse me?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
And the church.
I'm listening.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
No, I'm just going to head home.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Am I what they had in mind?
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
No.
What's with you?
Right.
What?
Definitely.
Is this crazy?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
I love the symphony.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Magic.
It's me?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why me? What about Jay?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What's she talking about?
Where's your mom?
Yeah.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
No.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
You'll like it.
Do you want a fruit plate?
What?
Stressed.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Will she scratch up your back?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Not now, Jonah --
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Victoria? She's okay.
Did not.
Do you like it?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
I read an article about this ...
No thanks.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
They say I am no good to you.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Alone?
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
You've got to help around the house!
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
Are you Australian?
First rate, ain't it?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Nothing.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
They would have killed you too.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
My features. They're Finnish.
Can your man handle that?
What does that mean?
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
When?
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
I was trying to score some dope.
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
And you've got wiener breath.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Maybe he isn't showing.
What is it, drugs?
Don't worry about it.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Yes, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
You must be a hell a shot.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
White-walls?
You think the rest of us were?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
Hell of a mission.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
It doesn't take this.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
And what about your own hand?
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
I know.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
We can't leave it here.
Why's that?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
No, sir.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Lingerie.
Yeah?  So?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Because he's guilty.
Good for her.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Okay, I got it.
So, what's your point?
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I know that.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Yes, I...
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
No.
What?
Or, or I could always wear this one.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
You're cold.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
You need to study?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Not right now, thanks.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The guy with the Datsun?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Yeah.
I don't really know where we are.
What -
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Good.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
Yeah, sure.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
You asked for shoe polish.
Of course I'm on it.
You're a good man.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Yes.
Christmas presents.
Ah, yes.
Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
More.
No?
Would it do any good?
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I live here.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Not until youre dead.
You have a right to be angry.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
No, I don't.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
She dumped me.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
It's under control.
Good question. You took the bait.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Youre the one who got away.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I think you're all an act.
Meaning?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Let's find out.
Over here.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Watch your back.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Where is your attacker?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I get scared really easy, okay.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Who is this?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Thanks.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I'm on duty.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Fuck!
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Bitch.
Good twist.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
It's Sarah.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Yes.
How do I know their voices are --
I thought you wanted me here?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
No one's saying you did.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
You rode your bike out there?
What's that?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
It's okay. We need to talk.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Who is this?
So why did you dial it again?
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
You never told me your name.
That's not what you said.
Don't...
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
I'll even give you a warm up question.
I don't know. I guess.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
No you didn't.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Working, thank you.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
Like you had one.
I'll be right back.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
It's past seven.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Deal.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
Announcing what?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
One is gluttony.
Yeah.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You know that's not true.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Sit back.
What the fuck is going on here?!
No one yet.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
How's that?
Bear with me.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
Who pays the rent on time.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
I don't.  Neither do you.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Kiss me on the lips.
I can't let you do this...
I don't know why... why now?
Are you absolutely certain?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
I'm sorry, I only...
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
It was, I tell you!
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Yes, sir...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Ain't yours yet.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Yes, sir.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
That don't make 'em kin...
Good night.
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
From the beginning...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
Where?
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Do you have a better idea?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Does this dog here belong to you?
I've killed my husband!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Mercutio
The title won't do.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
And his ears.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
So what do we do?
Nobody knew!
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
How goes it, Will?
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Verona again.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Above Lord Wessex?
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I have to get back.
A lowly player.
Oh--I am him too!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Moonlight!
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
and thus unable to declare her love
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
You flatter, my lord.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Wait there.
Do you understand me?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I was trying to educate you.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Take his legs.
Not now. I have an idea.
Not eating what?
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Except the money.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Are you recording it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Just serve.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
His car's still there.
I'm just looking.
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Don't you?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
I see.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
If I think you're lying --
I'm not sure --
That guy, the one that died.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
For what?
A certain weakness.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
Same as everyone else.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What're you doing later?
I hope she's all right.
No, I know.
... what?...
Nobody can hear it.
Then it's not your problem.
I guess so.
Gee, this is great.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
What?
No shit.
Yeah.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
Well, yeah... you know.
Yeah.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Probably the bathroom.
I'd cut it...
Okay.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did you?
Did I what?
You did, didn't you?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
I don't know what gets into me.
I am you, you little bastard.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
What?
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
I have to see you.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Where?
What's gonna happen?
Do you really mean that?
Why am I great?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- well aren't you --
Let go of me.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Did you?
Did you?
Stop it.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Oh yeah?
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
I don't know what to...
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
What do they look like?...
Who?
Me!
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.


I'll call you back...

Okay, okay...
No you won't.
Who were you talking to?
That's not very logical, Lester.
Aren't you going to have one?
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I'll call you.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Honey?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Sure.
Good for you.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
No.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
What was the Donner party?
What do you mean?
No.
Is there something bad here?
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny!
Is Tony one of your animals?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Yes.
Sure.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Yes, sir.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Yes...
Go away from me.
I'm intrigued.
Well, my predecessor in this job
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
All the best people.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Will you?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What if it's some kind of monster?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
What?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Yeah! What is it?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
I will- be good, kids.
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
What?
What did who say?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
Again!
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Excuse me?
Right.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
It's true!
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Check your driver's license.
Deal.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
I got it.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Out of the question.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Think again!  And get out of here.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
He didn't do you a favor.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You son-of-a-bitch!
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
That's not the point!  They need me!
Yeah, like what?
Really.
You won't even tell us?
That's what I figured, too.
Yes?
Really...
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
However, we can also pray for other things.
Find 'em!
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
You need to sleep.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Well... that might be... helpful.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Western Woods.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Lady Van Tassel.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Other people?
My suitor?
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
To avenge his father, and the others.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What would you have me believe?
His horse.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine.  Now, I must...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
No.
I can't remember.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Good to know you, Karl.
Sure.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
French-fried potaters.
Yeah.
Give me the big'uns.
Karl's my name.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
Catch you later Freddy!
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Please Doyle, don't.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
Would y'all like that?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
I hate you!
I aim to kill you with it.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Childers.
What are all them books?
Yeah.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
All right then.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Well, I hate him.
All right then.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Is that right?
Yeah.
No sir.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I never was no good with history.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
I didn't aim to.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Okay.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Karl is a guy guy?
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
No thank you.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
An invitation?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Forty-one pages.
Huh?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's kind of overwhelming.
Slow down, huh?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You usually get two.
Anything good?
You got it.
I'm all ears.
She probably died.
I mean, it's a good story.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Where to?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, you can't just write her off.
For keeps.
I almost got married once.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
What can I do for you?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And you told your nephew about it?
Those are pretty hostile words.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Not a one.
It was just a thought.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
I mean breakfast.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You can't be more specific than that?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
No way.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
It wasn't my fault.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Lettuce and tomato?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
It is.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
Yes.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
Fell.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
And what do you believe?
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
No spare.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Not in those words.
He had no reason to.
That's all he said.
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
Fresh!
Manhattans?  This time of night?
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
You're right, Joe.
But suppose he loses?
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
You don't see any blood?
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
Watch it, Daphne!
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Like when?
Oh.
Yeah - lets shove off.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
There you go with that we again.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
I guess she's not in here.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Yes.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
You don't say.
Goodbye?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Sorry.
I don't care.
Because I got some plans -
Yes, Joe.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
That so?
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Saxophone player?
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
That's very interesting.
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
What a beautiful fish.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
You mean - like frigid?
Nothing at all?
What else is there for me? 
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths - now really!
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Coffee?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Yes, sir.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Bacardi 151.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Or Kat....
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Im a hooker.
I had to say something to get you here.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
No, tell me.
I have regrets.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Why?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
I do?
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
What?!
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Desperation?
What?! No, no. You cant--
Hi, kiddo.
I havent thought about that in years.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
That does it...
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
But where is my daddy!?
What do that mean?
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
She was dirty and wet...
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
I think so...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Thank you, Daddy...
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Yes, ma'am...?
I don't look like no possum!
That's right!
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
I'll walk...
Well, let me have it.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Whatcha wanta order?
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
I hate the environment.
I said -
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
Oh.
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
A hunger strike? For what?
I don't know.
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Hey, Chef.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Dude, what the hell is going on?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
What's the difference?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Yes?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Cool!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
And ze rope?
He's shutting off the air!!!
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I'm sure I will.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Well shut it off at once!
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Thank you.
Uh...
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
That's me.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Close every door behind you!
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
I can't!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
That is one of my priorities.
What are you going to do about it?
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
It was a clearance.
Sure, Sid.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
I'd buy it!
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Clam it!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You shouldn't touch her.
I don't want to play.
SHEILA!
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Why would you help me?
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Yeah.
Like this?
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Coming right up.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
No, not at all.
Why were you suspended?
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What's plan C?
So why do you stay?
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'll be at the bridge.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
He's dead Sheila.
Are you sure he's dead?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
What about plan C?
Can you change something this big?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Your time is up, busyboy.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Nobody move!
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Forty yards.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Geologists?
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
How drastic?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
You don't think weapons are important?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Pull it.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
They've left, keep watching!
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
A break for what?
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
Too big?
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Yeah, why?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You did, didn't you?
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Beth --
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
Wait a second --
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
I don't know.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Valdomet.
A synthetic opium analogue.
How do you spell it?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Doesn't say.
For what?
Not believing you.
What do you mean, different?
How's Harry?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Yes.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Beth --
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Beth --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Another attack?
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Wait a second, I --
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
What noise?
You remember opening the door?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
That's right.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
But it's impossible.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived?  From where?
Thank you.
The ships?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Captain who?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You seen my suitcase?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Four.  Four years --
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
It could be worse...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Come back here... Where are you going?
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Well, maybe you better look again.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Not enough, I guess.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Others are waiting.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Alright, I love you.
You don't look very happy to see me.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
What happened to your eye ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
You used to dance...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Been better, buddy.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
<U>Answer</U>!
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
It's taken control of the computer...!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
No!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Twelve seconds...!
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Precisely.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Go you Huskies?
I need a typewritter.
I have one, but they lost it.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
That whole...
Everyday things...yes.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
Cast stood me up.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What are you doing down there?
You got a paperclip?
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
That's right...
Is it...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...you think that's right...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
I've been thinking.
I'm sorry.
Courthouse back in town.
What?
And I need a drink.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
I will.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Fifteen hands.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
I'm having dinner with W...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
You can go...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
No, you're absolutely r...
Everybody needs a hob...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
...wants a piece...
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Well.
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Later for you, pal.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I...?
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Why?
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
I don't getcha.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I don't...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
Find the money.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Is he cool or angry?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Excellent point.
Mass hysteria.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Why does Rachel scream?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Actually.  I could only help him.
You don't like his friends.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Until he's old enough to read.
Good.  That's very good.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Hold lunch!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Alright starve.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Mommy?
Thursday's fine...
Rache can do that part.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Every day.  More and more.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
I'm here.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Me too.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Just not to me.
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
And we all went through that together?
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
We're going to win this.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
You're the hip and fresh.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
But?  But what?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
What?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
No.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My grandchild-baby.
Poison gas.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Is everything OK?
What's tomorrow?
Tired of this shit...
One in a million recover.
OK!
Well, now you have.
That's good.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Thank you for being honest.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah. But not any more.
How'd you get it?
Yeah?
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Who's got matches?
Yeah?...
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
Yes, you should.
Shut up!
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Give that back to me.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
No, sir.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
And if that were true?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
I'm trying to, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
They're coming in now.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
I've got one.
What's your point, Lothar?
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Seond safety.
What happened?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
Sorry, King.
I'm okay.  What's up?
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
Sure, King.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Can I have some?
In Group?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
No I quit.
It's really not about anything.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Now?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Yes!
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
A long, long, long...
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Buff...
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Yeah.
Shit.
Buff is funny. God.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Are you talking to me?
Well, play it, man.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
No, not really. Middle-class.
He is.
Oh, yeah?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sure.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Two-fifty? They go up?
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
That, that's Indian?
I gave it to you.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
I know, I know, I know.
I hate that.
Okay, so maybe later.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
One!
What? What do you stand for?
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
New ground?
My goal is to make art.
Jeff!
Go.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So how's college?
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
Yeah.
That was so great!
If...
No, I'm going.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, my god!
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Oh, How'd she get back?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Yeah?
Just one?
Come on, Jeff.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Sorry, Kansas...
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Bye.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Positive.
And they get caught!
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
We're here for you, Diane.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
That was the general idea.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Check.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
It will?
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Who's who?
I just don't.
You did.
Come on in, Betty,
This is where you live?
Whose?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
It is not.  Get out.
Yeah?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You can stay here.
Just a scene I cut out.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Come on!
Cut out that us business.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Thank you, darling.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
Dressed for what?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Is that so!
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
What doctor?
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What?
You say the cutest things.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
But where?
Softball.
Am I? Still?
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's for your own protection.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Miss what?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
I bet they do.
What an adorable hat.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Yeah.
Can I quote you?
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Did anybody notice you?
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
I don't scare that easily.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Brad.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
I didn't --
But Lana, you could --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Anyday...
Sure.
Oh?
Mmmmm . . .
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.

Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Is this whitemail?
What do you want?
You designed it?
Anything.
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
We've already met.
Tell me.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Gus?
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Where did it come from?
A normal person.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
I'm sorry.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
North.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Stay. I will come to you.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Clark . . . wait!
But Superman isn't an average man.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
He's thirty-five years old.
One of them should've been you.
What's she doing in California?
I know.
Not really, no.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
He may have a gun!
Huh?
Big night coming up?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Jealous? Of what?
I didn't say a word.
I read the article.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Bingo!
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Then -
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
-- as we will be.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Twenty-four.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
He is. Usually.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Okay.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Oh.  Right.
Say hello for me.
Your kids never cry.
Just like we look forward to this.
From what?
No.  I saw it on his face.
What do you mean?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
We've only got honey.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
From you?
Did he say what about?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
So he was mean?
Should I keep reading?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Was the bus on time?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
When?
Perfect.
Daddy?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
You've been retained?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
You are?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
There wasn't time?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Really?
Don't even try to remember.
The ramp?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Thanks, I see him...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Talk to her yourself...
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
And where was his wife?
Hello.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
He wants me to break a leg?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
I'm used to you...
I know you do, Sidney.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
If you want me to -
Why not you?
Yes, but why?
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Smile?
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Terminated.
I order you not to!
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
No!  Don't kill him!
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
I have detailed files.
Can you get us in there, past security?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
Yes.
So what is it?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Yes.
Of course.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Did you call someone you knew?
Sure.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
How?
What did Goering say?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Okay, so what is it?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
How could I forget?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
You're a big help.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
The what?
Freezing.
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
About what?
Molecular-memory.
Hot dogs?
Not possible.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl.  You know.
No.  Never.
Why?
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Okay.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
What?
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Oh.  FIne.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Where'd you get this?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
I didn't say anything.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
... what... ?
Guess you missed it.
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Big family... small?
Boyfriend?
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Why would you say that?
What have they been doing to you?
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
You're part of it...
Yes, very lucky.
Of course, Nick...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
Humor me with specifics.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Attempted murder.
Go ahead.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
And then what happened?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
No --
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
David.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I'm sorry.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
No reason.
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Has he?
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
That's not what I heard.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Now who's being sarcastic?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
What line is he in.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
I can see the attraction.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
He had urgent business in the north.
Which kind?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
You do?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Walked.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Exercising my visitation rights.
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
That's what he keeps telling me.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
No. Uh... family friend.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well? How'd she do?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
I can get it, yeah.
And how do we share--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
Mm.
How's business, Dave?
Uh-huh.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
I'm fine.
How d'ya like them apples?
Huh?
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Whuddya mean?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
That's very generous.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
They sent us to tell ya.
Homicide.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
I'm in.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
What's the combination?
Calm down.  I found it!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Like hell!
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
What's left of it.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement?
May I see that?
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Read it out loud.
I don't believe it.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Like this.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
He's right.  Follow me.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
So what?
Eats them?
How about lunch?
How does it work?
No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Then it won't go after the others?
I have to shoot.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
Where exactly?
You want to book the flight?
He gave it back to his father.
What music?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
It has to be the reality.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Saturday?
Nursery?
Oh, God.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Oh, my God!
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
A woman?  Work.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Penetration but not perforation.
They took her --
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Looking for him for what?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Where are you, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.
I'm in the vending room.
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
You're... quitting?
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
I can't really talk right now.
Mulder --
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Mulder --
For the purpose of what?
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
About what?
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Yes.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
What alien environment?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
...give a kiss to Edward.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Evil.
Little boy?!  That's him!
I can't leave him!
Good for them.
He's beautiful...
Mocky-Lock.
You're kidding me.
I think that's the whole point.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
No.
I doubt that.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
You're looking well.
What about the cat?
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
Oh...
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
They're Harry's.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
Where?
You a friend of Lime's?
Once in a while.
Ever seen one?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Certainly.
Of course, of course, of course.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
She's been arrested.
And - Anna...
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
What else?
Yes.
Just take it, OK.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
What!
What happened?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Two.
So?
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They had Sabra and Shattila.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
I don't, but...
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Oh, really?
Then how come you're talking to me?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
That's stupid.
It looks a little like a swastika.
V'asitem...
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
How would you kill him?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And? WHat did you notice?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
He has Israel.
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
What were you, following me?
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Balint?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Steve's going to explain it.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Tell it to Hitler.
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Number ten.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Four. But no one this important.
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Leary?
We think you'd be good at it.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
No.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Yes.
Congratulations.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Enzo!
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
How many are, down there?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
It isn't lit yet.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
Enzo...
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
People say that?
Not at all!
What?
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
What is it?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
In the lake?
No... in the hut.
Give it to me.
I didn't dive.
I saw how it has to be.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No.  I'm just depressed.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
In the spring when he melts!
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I know sir. I won't let you down.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
That's right, of course.
Yes.
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Now look what you've done.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know -- Teresa -
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
You a tourist?
And that is the last time any...
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Excuse me?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
How... When did you...
My brother hung himself.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
...Were turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
You wouldnt understand.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Crow what?
Youre a long way from home...
Im fine standing, thank you.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Emily...
Why?
What sort have you got?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where are the kids?
What kids?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Got it. Puppies.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Your secretary, huh!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
We conclude our transaction.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
Three oclock.
What are you talking about?
Should I come back in five minutes?
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Er... Yes...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Fine...
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Excuse me?
Uh-huh.
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
O est pass ton salon?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
Whats that? A word?
So... pretend it's not a game.
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
I thought you were an archer?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Tell the king to give me more men.
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But it is what I want.
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
One day you will.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
We have to press home the attack!
I tried to.
Quite a few.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Where... where am I?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
You have nothing to regret...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
Yes.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
He's on the other side of the river.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
So... bring up the reinforcements!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Don't swear...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I... I never lied!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Who?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
No...
So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Oh yes... very.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
What... does he... look like?
Yes.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
He'll be back before curfew.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
What's happened?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
It certainly was.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Bitch!
No, it was a table.
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
And where did they get married?
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Spoken words?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
On your piano, that is the swap.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Naw, it's okay.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
If that's the way you want it.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
I picked something up on the way.
You know anything about him?
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Neither are we.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Lonnegan.
See ya and raise three.
Raise 5,000.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Maybe a couple million.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, figure something out.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
We missed him.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
And if it isn't?
I can't.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
He's all right.
He's a brave man.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Not at all.
Yes... yes.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
No.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Could this be him?
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
No.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Want to take a poke at him?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
I couldn't go near that woman.
Chris -- Chris -- !
So I see.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Is Julia going with you?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Well, don't you?
Yes...
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
No.
There's one coming.
Well, didn't you?
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
So am I.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I did find him!
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Police!
No... no.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Y-yes.
Baghdad.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
So we wait.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
We thought--
I have to answer him.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Wait.  Wait.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Oh, that's fun.
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
They're not going to--
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Just be cool.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
We'll find our way.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
What?  Yeah.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
What are we going to do?
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I don't know.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
I could use some recon photos too.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Naw, nothing.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
We have to do something.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
Stress category.
What's the matter with you?
Eat your dinner.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
Not very encouraging.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
When?.....How?
...and you're not lost now?
Look more closely.
I don't know.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
Save yourself....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Where...?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Drive.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Where you guys at?
Right.
Which one's which?
"Punks", huh?
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
He's my brother...
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Look who's talking, old man.
It's about this.
IRA - instant retirement account.
Goddamit, Reilly--
I thought I told you--
Report on the case so far.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Pull back. You're only an observer.
And it had diamonds in the back.
In a moment.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Yes!
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
I hope so, too.
Two weeks and three days.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
I know it!
Now just a minute, Major--
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Last year? It can't be that long.
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Five, seven, and nine--
He recognized you!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
By the way, how is your German?
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh!
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Goodbye.
Precisely.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Like that?
Like that!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Giron...!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
It could have been marvelous ...
But it could have been glorious.
Please!  Thank you.
About what?
But you're the more intelligent one.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
Don't you mean work me?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Not the better half.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Bollocks.
We've struck ice.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
No, no! Just with her hands.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Just move with me. Don't think.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Baloney!
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Where's Lother?
Get moving--
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Good-by.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
What do you know about them?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Change?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
In New York.
How?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
O.K.! Send that!
Sure.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Yes--Me--in person!
Who won?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Yeah--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Very serious?
I'm getting seasick--
So what?
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
What for?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
The country boy's about due.
Why don't you leave me alone?
--you'd go with him!
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Because I was yellow, I guess--
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Absolutely nothing.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
In pace requiescat.
Not exactly...
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
But Doc-
Sorry, sorry...
Then what do I do?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
A which?
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
How is he?
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Doesn't suit you.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I hate Sadie.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
You wanted to talk?
Forget it, Ringo.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Sightseeing.
So why did you leave?
Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this
Where can I find him?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Let's take a look at the body.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
If not?
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Captain Morton.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
You leave me no alternative.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
Approaching the first gate.
Fueled and waiting.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Will the cruise set it off?
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
They're too big.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
How old are you?
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Hush.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I will appreciate that.
You must have been really sick.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Everything these days is made overseas.
You should go back and rest.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
My mother passed on years ago.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Okay...
Here!  In the car!
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Rocky!  The ramp!
No, you can't.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Sorry.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Hold still, Buzz!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Stay calm, everyone!!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Oh no, Hannah!
She's sick!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Okay, save your batteries!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Uh-oh.
That's right.  Your toys.
Speed up!
Is that all?
Well ... yes. All right. But -
It was only a mouthful!
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Why are you talking like that?
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl --
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
I don't know.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Is this bad for him?
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
You can't make me.
I'm third in my class.
I get A's.  All A's.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
So does half of San Diego.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
We can protect you.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
You will dine with me from now on.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I don't believe you.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
What's he doing up here?
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Who?
What is the name of your informant?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
But will he be house-trained?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
You won't say anything to my parents?
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
What kind of research?
Well, I've not brought them.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
You were in my way.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
I'd fucking kill you.
What's your name?
Diane.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
No, not holding hands.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Is that a promise, then?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
Eh? How's that?
Now?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
And you might get the fucking job.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Director?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Roald Dahl.
What do you mean?
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
It wasn't that bad.
God, you're sick.
It was my fucking television.
It was just an idea.
Four Grand.
That's tough.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
No joy yet.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
He doubts me.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Raise shields.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Because it's there.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
Why?
To land any closer would risk detection.
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Uh-uh.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I cannot go with you.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Want one?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Okay, okay...
For being on to Dillinger.
Hello, Alan.
Yeah...?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No...
Right on the money!
Flynn?
Cute.
End of line.
I'm sorry -
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
User requests are what computers are for.
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Not us, I hope.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Tron...?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Okay, Dad.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
She's having an affair.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
He needed my help.
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
No.
Harry... snap out of it!
Dance?
So what's your angle?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Worse than Cairo?							*
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
He wants to speak with you.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
And here we are.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
I'd love some pie.
How 'bout me what?
I don't remember.
What's your favorite color?
Yes, I would.
Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Almost four years.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
At the movies?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
That dazzling imagination.
My pimp.
Will you be my wife?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
I just gotta get somethin'.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
That rhymes.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Live with what?
You'd really do that?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Tell me.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Two guys.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
No. No, you don't.
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
No.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I really don't know.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
What about him?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
You and Robin moved?
Absolutely.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Donowitz, he said.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I need to go now.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
I have to go.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Jeffrey Mason?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Yes, sir.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
He's been tested for drugs?
Christ no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's my morning's pay.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Where to?
Where in Mexico would you like--
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Sheriff Potter.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
What does it look like?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You sure you can manage?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That a fact?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I have ideas.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
We're going all the way.  Together.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
No.  I swear it.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
I'm her husband.
You've got to be--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Isn't that illegal?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
I need thirteen.
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
SHUT UP!
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Soda.  You know.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
It ain't broke.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
About what you said this morning.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What the hell are you talking about?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Darrell.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
That's right on my way.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
And what would that be?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Is that why you're with him?
I don't know how.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Try me.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Stop it.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
'Cause I love you.
How much?
Sure, I'll try.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
I think I burned my gun hand!
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Wow.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I know.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Yes. Is this David?
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
What about the game?
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
But not a knife?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Yes he is.
No.
I'm not scared.
Do you know why?
How long have you been married?
How did you get together?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where is it?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
We was... lyin'.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Nope.
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
You want... a free one.
Yeah, I guess.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Uh... a little, maybe.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
And?
Did you... kill him?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
N-no, sir?
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Shut up, Kid.
You still think he's in there?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Yeah?
Two weeks, I guess.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
How far kin you see?
I seen him.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
He's blind, for Chri...
Yeah.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Who ?
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
You are a criminal.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
What time is it?
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I shivved him.
Which is shit.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
Came from Redfoot.
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
I never heard of him.
I don't
Edie.
Because he was my friend.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
You think he's..?
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Yes.
What is the truth?
It looks that way.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes!
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Just now...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
It was good of you to meet...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
There's nothing they can do to me.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
Nothing happened.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Still looking.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
Yes.  It was, actually.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
And are they going to get it?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
It's a long road that has no turning.
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
Huh.
How long have you been back?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Let me come in.
Judy Barton.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
About three years.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Mmm.
No.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Please! And don't look at me.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
Yes!
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
We'll find him.
Where were you?
My name is John Ferguson.
Wander about.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
I don't like them.
No.
When?
Home?
Yesterday.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Too late... there's something I must do...
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go! Let me go!!
What is her name?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Ah, Johnny-O...
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I've never run across one like that.
Well?
Sorry, old man. Work.
What.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Oh?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I thought so!
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Multiple reasons.
You fucking bastard!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What are you talking about?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
At the seven-eleven.
Adam! Calm down.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
What does that mean?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Here's his head.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
You always were a jealous man.
What did you ask me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
What?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Yeah.
Isn't it a little late?
You're sick.
The hell I did!
What's your point?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
I do.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Florist?
Yes.
Why?
Well it's bad timing.
Problems?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
That's sweet.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
I know.
You fucked a prostitute?
But...
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
No...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Come on.
I think so.
Did she believe you?
Where?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The post-Vegas Man.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
You have no feelings toward ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Yes, sir.
And in the vegetable plot?
That's good land.
He was asking for it.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
She's left.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
There's been an accident.
Yes!
All right, Mother.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
From the terrace.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
I don't know.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
I'm still making adjustments...
What's wrong with Parker?
Turn it down!
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Enough!
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
...I think so...You?
My guess is dead.
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
What'd ya think?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
I'm working on it.
The American "people"?
...that's the general idea.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
What do you know about them?
What did Albania ever do to us?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<u>So</u> forth...
Never quit a winner.
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
To preserve their Way of Life.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
Why would they want that?
We don't need an Act Two.
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
How's our friend?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
I'm looking for a phone...
It's too clean.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Surest thing you know.
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
A beret.
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Please, no thanks... 
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Then get out and close it behind you.
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
You speak for me, son.
What are you doing here?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Okay.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
And what do you want?
Well, why stop at that?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
He still likes you
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Businessman?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
A little?
Right.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well divide 18 into three
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Then we both are.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
No.
What do you think?  Guess.
I am.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Um...
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Of course.
He was so pissed.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
What?
Seance.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
This.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Something was there.  You saw it.
No.
Three weeks.
Three o'clock.
Not the focus.
I know.
Nope.
Tomorrow.
Why?
But what if something happens?
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
That's...
You didn't?
Did you call about the Feurs?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
...Don't get all...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
STOP IT!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
I'm not going to listen to this.
How did she know where it was?
Do you know it?
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Shhhh.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Two heartbeats.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
He made that quite clear, yes.
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
She didn't feel them
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Now, lasher - it is our time.
uh - then he - be just -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
To love, you must be able to feel.
I LOVE him!
I do not understand...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
The one time I want it to work...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
All I meant was -
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
God knows, I'm intriguing.
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hello..
Maybe he's just - waiting...
What were you talking about...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Where do you kill them...
I don't know...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Open it...
I am sorry...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You heard me - keep away from him
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
At home alone - where were you?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Ladies first.  I insist.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
You know...take the pictures?
I mean, what do you think?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
They're in the ignition, silly.
That's me.
Hmmm?
You mean they knew who I was?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
I doubt it.
Let's do it.
Tell me more.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
You think we should be more open minded?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Bad news.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I... You know... I...
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
No.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
You could say that.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Yes.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
You are.
Hi, Mon.
Whichever one I want.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
You know what it takes.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You can't...
I did.  At Blue Balls.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Aha?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Yes.  Now, observe....
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Hey, I tried the board.
Well... that, too.
It's not a guy...
Relax.  We're almost there.
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
French?
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And?
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Philistine.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
When are they coming?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Right.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Not today, Willow.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
No.  I mean yes.
Say what?
He's no magician.
Farmer.
What is it?
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
She's a bird, Willow.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
No!
Kill him!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
His will.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Why?
I changed her already!
I don't know much about him.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who??
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Good, you start tomorrow.
I thought I was the English.
Yes, sir.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
You have no right to keep us here.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
But why?
But 
Can I have something to drink?
Two days.
Something wrong with buttons?
We had some lemonade and he left.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I was being foolish?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
I hear you.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
I have to help him!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
No... No. It is just the English way.
No --
Yes, darling.
No --
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast!  Not....
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Catch him, you fool!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Toto, too.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Aw, come, come, come --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Did you say something?
Oil can....
Well, you're perfect now.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh --
Ohh!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Ohhh!
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
What?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
What's the matter?
I -- Oh --
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Hold still - hold still --
Whozat?
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
To Oz?
A heart --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
You know something?
Oh --
Yeah --
It makes you nervous?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, I --
Yes -- ....
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
Bond --
Elektra King.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
Perhaps after this ... test?
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Consider me ungrateful.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
No. Youll be safe here.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
What?  This is not possible.
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
Of course...
What do you think?
Where it can do the most damage.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
She's with me.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Maybe not, but why take chances?
What are you up to?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
What do I get out of it?
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!

This is a gift. From me to you.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
I don't like him being here.

No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Uh-huh.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Senator?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.

The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is it enough?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
You have the wrong house.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Why does he call you 'master'?
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
I don't know what you mean, sir.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Fron kon steen!
What?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
My father was a sick man.

How do you know it was a 'he'?
Maybe...if you get here on time.

That sound good, boss.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
... It's.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.

I know.
Good night!
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Three minutes to go!
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
