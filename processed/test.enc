You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like you care.
What?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
You set me up.
I just wanted --
Why?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
He's pretty!
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Leave my sister alone.
I just upped my price
Nope - just came by to chat
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's never been proven
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
I say, do what you wanna do.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
BIANCA
Wholesome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Yes
My grandmother's .
It wasn't like that.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
No, Daddy.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tempestuous?
What?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What just happened?
We should have seen land.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Can't you stay with us a little?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
How far from here?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What does he say?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Chief says...
God... That's in a week!
How can you be so certain?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
I believed in you...
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Don't say anything.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Back in the Czech Republic?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Divorced.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
A cop?
It was my decision, not his.
Chief - mind if I take her?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
What's he looking for?
Sorry...PD only.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Nah, I musta missed it.
I don't even watch TV.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Of course.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
How many victims are up there?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
You're ruthless.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Tonight.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Any chance we can do that again?
And what do you do with the bones?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Two weeks holiday.
How long are you planning to stay?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Robert...?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
What are you coming here to do?
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Clean?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
How?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Any ideas about the colour?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
True.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
I hear you've got visitors.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You lying son of a bitch...
Yeah?
You're crazy.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Hey, this works pretty good.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Hey, you wanna bet?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
We split 50-50?
Where's the money?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No class...
Where's luther?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, I see her.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Who are all these?
You look awful.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
No wonder you're so popular.
Hello.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
How do you know?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Can't complain.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Five bills.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
So you do know her.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
Where's Leeloo?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I don't have time... I need to know.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Six to the left. One to the right.
Cornelius..
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Apipoussan?
I'm so very sad.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You're killing me...
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
That's five thousand dollars.
I'll consider it.
I'd rather you didn't.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
I figured you share information.
We do.
What's he talking about?
Don't ask questions.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You got absolute zero.
I never killed anyone.
Never mind how I found you.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You're asking me why?
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
There's not much illegal.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Wha... ?
Who is he, his name?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
You don't have any other choice.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Are you religious?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Hello... ?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Hey...wake up.
How did you know that?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Alice!
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Who's Jacob?
Where are you going?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
Course and speed?
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
You played for the Sox?
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Open the door, will ya?
It's not that.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
You're a policeman.
You mean Twombley?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
It's just...
Mel Gordon.
How's she doing?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Then... I guess you have to.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Strange.
Of course! I would've heard.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Bang!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
You think Jack shot him?
That it wasn't an accident.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
A hunting accident is perfect.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Alice...
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
Some kids were teasing you?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
They aren't answering their hails.
I prefered the terrorists.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
I was reading too.
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Sir?
Elaine.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine, we have to go back.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Have you got it straightened out now?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Roger.
He's a boy dog.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Sixteen 'C', why?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Do you want to talk about it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Both pilots!
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Airsick?
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
You don't have squat.
William Harcourt?
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Let's talk Hubley.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
And that fits?
Why'd I do what?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
You are married?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Shit!
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
What is it?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
You did okay, Bishop.
Amy.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Still nothing from the colony?
What's he scanning for?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Locked.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
It's inside the complex.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Why not?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Don't go!  Please.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
A Turkish brothel.
Did you know? Had you heard?
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
No, I'm not playing this game.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
You borrowed money from your mother?
What's the matter with you?
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
What?
Oh, Stanzi.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
This is not his handwriting.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Where's our friend?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Leave him alone!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Behold!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
A-flat, Majesty.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
They say you're in debt.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
What medicine?
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Put it down!
What is this?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Ah!
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No! No, it's him!
The Fire.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Do you have it?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.
All Vienna has heard that.
No, you didn't!
He's setting that play to music?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Well, promise then.
How did he look?
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
No, why?
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I dream of death mostly.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Yes, go on.
Will you come with me?
Will you think about it?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Of course.
I should be committed.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
No what?
No.
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
So they said.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Jack.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
That's a wolf's head.
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
What?!
I'm not listening!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
You look awful.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
I could hang myself.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Oh.
Hello, Tom.
Yes - sure
Oscar, what's the matter?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Yes, sir.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well
Why are you so anxious?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Good morning.
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Helen!
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
No. I won't.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Is it safe?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Yes.
Well . . . ?
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Yes.
How are you fixed?
You can ride like that?
He's smiling.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Nope.
Damn!
What?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Perfect, Cole.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
What the --
Of St. Louis?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I figure.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
What do you think?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Bob's upset.
We're doing this for Ma.
Jim was old enough...
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
Ma! Please!
But still died.
You shouldn't be up.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
"Hmm" what?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
And you're too young.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
You been with a girl ever?
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
They had to be dealt with!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
This is him.
You wouldn't have done that?
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Nice?
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Why?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Patrick?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's rich.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
How did you guess?
Listen, what about dinner?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Call me please, Patrick.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
What's that, a gram?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Anywhere you want?
Jean? Sorbet?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
What's that?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
She's my...cousin.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Oh no, I'm okay.
How old are you?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
Yeah...Yale thing.
No. Not really.
Actually, yes.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
People just...disappear.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Hey, Halberstam?
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
Teddy was killed last night.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
They hack into people's programs?
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
You're living here?
Is it your software?
We could move 'em up here.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Oh. Yeah.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
That's great! Thanks.
Ready for number three?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Come with me.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
What about the FBI?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
I met this girl.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Or sometimes not at all.
Hey, how are you?
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
When do I begin?
Thank you, Exposition.
Excuse me?
Be careful.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Why did you leave so soon?
Why?
Let's go get him!
Of course, luv.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Hello, luv.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
Everything seems to be in order.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Knight ...
Black...
... love ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
1922. Why the kippers?
Rules are made to be broken.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Steed, we really must be --
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
Is there anything that isn't?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
To kill me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
What's that you're wearing?
I know all this.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
We want Mrs. Peel.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Insane ... ?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
I was hoping you could tell me.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
No, please! I beg you ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
I was at Harrow ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Cole...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Maybe it had something to do.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Cole, we've got to talk.
I'm going now, Cole.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Good...
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Let's go.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Great bathing suit.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
You're a pimp?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
You want to share it?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Are any of those right?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Rick!
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
What the hell is that?
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
How'd it go?
Who was that?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Is he...
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
This?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Jennifer.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hi.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
I'm sorry.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
What'll you do?
Who's doing this?
I don't have a story.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What?
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
No.
So what do you want me to do?
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Brian?
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Completely out of control.
Coffee sucked.
Dad!
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Okay.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
-- Burn them.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
"The Strawberries"?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
So what are you doing here?
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Yeah!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
What do you do?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Good morning, Cheeba.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
And I'm the feet.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
That ain't funny.
What do I have to do?
To what?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
What do you want?
It's been a long time.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
I'm in till the end.
Please don't go there.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You sound like the media.
I don't believe it.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
What do you mean?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
A lot?
You're sure this is a good idea.
What?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Aw, c'mon.
Why don't you answer?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Have you had one?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
You want my heart?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
As much as possible.
Yes!
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
I see.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, my little darling.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
You too?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
That'd be my reaction too --
And he'd been shot.
We don't need the tapes --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
He -- He made me do it --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
You mean not enough to save you.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Hardy, what are you doing --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
What if I don't want it?
That's not true.
You're a good man, Hardy.
What are you doing out here?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Pike never confessed.
It won't work --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Or are you too scared?
Will.
In so many words, yes.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I'll...
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
No, I understand.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I can.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Karl.
Jesus Christ.
Am I?
Really.
You mean, while I'm here.
You know where the chemicals are?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Tell me how it happens.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
'Fraid so.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
But it's not true.
You're not.
How did you get here?
How much time does he have left?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
Binoculars.
What was that?
Do you believe in love?
Oh Jesus.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
They go. John. They go.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
Where's the restroom?
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
What?
You don't understand me.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
I wasn't saying anything.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I don't want anyone to die.
Okay. Thank you.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Oh! Gave me a start.
At church?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Holy shit.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I keep the heat on.
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I said... STOP!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
By myself?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Or what?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
The hell is this shit?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Keep the change on that.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
This ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Are you wasted?
I feel better. Do you?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
What are they doing now?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Frank Abolofia.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
I didn't know.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This the right place?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Give me a break, would you?
Why weren't you at the platform?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Did I say that?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
No...
No.
Someone attacked him.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Could you fill me in?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
You trust me?
Where?
One man.  He must be good.
And what can he do for you?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
You could help us.
He could?
You're our best and only friend.
What was he after?
Yeah.
Yeah.  I got it.
Day after tomorrow.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Okay, but...
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
Yeah?
My job is here.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
What night?
What shows?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
It's a good job.
The best.
I bet I would.
Are you apprehensive?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Did you cry when your father died?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
How come you were in my truck?
What about friends?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
Come where?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No, I'm lost.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Name it.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
The big one!
It does?
I told you I've never driven before!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
The guy with the underpants!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
Really?
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
You wanted to see me!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
I know first aid!
Sing it to me.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Are you all right?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Yes, father?! Yes?
Uh-huh.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
And it's called...?
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Good-bye, Adam.
Hello.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Right here!
Why?
Calvin!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
How long will you set it for this time?
So where is your roommate, the model?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Oh, yes.
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
He go back to the hotel?
What?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Then what?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yes?
Why do you do it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Only you and the photo lab.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Jeffrey.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Well.
No. Come on.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like me?
Do you know?
Look.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
I'm doing it.
Sometimes I think I do.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I'll call you.
What?
Oh no.
Who, Dorothy?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Go where?
There ya go.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Can I use the car tonight?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Where are they?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
So, what's next?
Yes. I do.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Who, me? Why should it?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
What am I going to do?
What did he bring him in for?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Yes sir.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Yes.
What happened?
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
We're alive.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nine bodies.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
She was in here when it went down.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
What?
The Greeks. The Italians.
What about one guy with two guns?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
This is some crazy shit, man!
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You're right.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, I saw it.
Like he meant it.
What's wrong with him?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
See if mine are in there.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
May I have a word with you, please?
Where was it parked?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I wish I'd been there.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I'm not. But there's --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
What is it?
You could give somebody a concussion.
He doesn't want to fight.
Shit, Dignan.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
As a person?
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
Pretty much everything.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
You mean a safecracker?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Are you serious?
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Give him a second.
Cuba.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
You stole a Trans-Am.
It's true, Dignan.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I paid for it.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
That's too bad.
What are you doing?
What happened?
This is natural.
The weed.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Bullshit.
Come on!
Come on, Bob.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
What's that?
Wait a second --
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Join the party, fellas.
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
Well, I left some money in there.
No. I just have short hair.
Got a little lucky.
What?
Come on in!
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Because you're afraid!
Is this really happening?
Conklin.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I should be better by now.
So...
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
No. You never worked Berlin.
No... Jason... please...
I was here!
What's that?
That's where we came out.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Mr. Nevins?
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Wallace's followers.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Rest, William.
I don't want to be a martyr.
You'll move
We must run in different directions!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Nor I!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I don't know. These things take time.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Not if you remember my dad.
Of course.
So it didn't feel... weird?
What do you mean?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
What time is it?
...yes.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Huh?
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Does he know that?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I won't.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It's not for sale.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Why there is no other man in my life?
My German's a little rusty.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Be careful.
Did he give any reason?
Ask me?
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
What for?
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes. What is it you want?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Even in Berlin.
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Ho, diplomatist!
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
I was misinformed.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
His escape.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Yeah, you were saying?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Yeah? Why?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
What friend?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Uh huh.
Make it official, if you like.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Then don't have a drink.
What's that you're playing?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It's bad.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Nothing out there but ocean.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You know what happened to this?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Yeah, a long one.
Four four.  A record.
You know, for when you travel.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
There isn't any us.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
If I'd known you were alive --
I love you, Chuck.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
I am one lucky guy.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Really?
Can you find her?
You fucked us over.
I was making a point.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
They just want you to hire some new help.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
So. Not bored yet?
People watched the movies in their cars?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You don't understand! It's her father...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I love you, Wally.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You mean somebody asked?
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Migrants?
But she's your *daughter*...
What's that? What's it called?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
Yes, for both.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
That's *it*?
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
I told him that you all is sick.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
After you cut her loose.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
Sorry, I --
Oh Jesus!
What is this? You guys cops or something?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
What do I have to do?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You told me to change my hair!
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Jesus... Take it easy.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Can't say.
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
You sell it.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You called the casino a cesspit.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
Eight-fifty.
And your lady?
Not entirely.
I want to hear it.
You're shaking. What is it?
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Why did you take the money?
I want to buy a car.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Absolutely not.
What happened?
What kind of trouble?
And I thought you were only after my body.
What for?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
You've done pretty well.
Rough day?
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Five.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
The key!
Key?
The key!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, then...
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hey, bomb...
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
...nine seconds...
Yes.
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Doolittle, hello?
Sir?
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Who's Camille?
Move it.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Lemme put some clothes on.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
I don't get involved with guns.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
Soon, baby.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Lauren's not my wife.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
How well do you remember the lab?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Who is it?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
No.
A little what?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Make the call.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Really?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Pick a song, Hawk.
No problem.
Right, slow...
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
What the fuck!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
They're what?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
I said, I'm sorry!
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
But we took the keys?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Is that your final answer?
Yeah, you did!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie.
Beg pardon?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
What did you say?
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
How much longer is this gonna last?
So... you just moved here?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And what?
That's alright... I understand.
Will you please talk to me?
Where is she?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Frank.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Can anyone else see him?
A sign from whom?
How does that make you feel?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Nothing.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
You've done it again?
Where are we going, Donald?
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Wicked.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
That's it, I'm goin'...
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Here, I didn't get any.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
I'm a mirror.
What?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Becky was my only shot at state!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
My dear President...  read it back...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Yes, sir. 
What kind of a dog is he?
I don't call him, I whistle.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
What'll I do with this card?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I thought everything was working out fine.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes.
You stay with me.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Good morning, Treves.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Are you comfortable here?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
How awful for John.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
John... Merrick
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
The hospital?
Ohhh...
Not at all, John.
Your mother?
Good morning, John.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Yes, John.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Well... where is he?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
WELCOME?
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you don't realize....
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
No... we don't...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
But you don't want to hear it.
REALLY?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Well you started it.
Scream.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
I... I... KILLED her...
Faster!
Why should WE care?
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
What's the matter with them?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
You will wait?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
My brother blacksmiths!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
I should have got rid of you long ago!
So did your father...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Shit. The last time I saw you.
You rat.
Oh, Tangerine.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Okay.
You're sure? It's cold.
Where do you live?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I like to read.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Take care.
Ready for another?
I don't know.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
You're not ready.
I don't want to talk about this here.
Oh, thank God. It's going.
You're drunk.
I want to know you.
Joely...
Such a beautiful view.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Egad, were you horrified?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I know.
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I knew.
So go.
What if you stay this time?
I think I should go back.
That's okay. I --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
I guess so.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
So then she just stops calling.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Do you swear you didn't know?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
I have a family, Mary.
It was a mutual decision.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Does that help?
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
I know who you are.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
I'm staying with the Countess.
A traveler, eh?
You're political, then?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
What are you doing?
Whooee!
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Ballast.
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
What?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
Can you shut it down?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
How do you know all this?
Jesus its huge.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Any survivors?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Yes, sir.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
But...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Blow it up?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Explosive decompression.
A straight line.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What is it?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
How'd you know it was me?
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
About me? How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What did you wish for, honey?
What about his first born?
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
How long was I out?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Are you alright?
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
So are you!
Not this again --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
How's the IPO?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Of course.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
On the ledge?
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Any problems?
Leave me alone!
Hey, Mike?
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Did you get her number?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I would. Yeah.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Naw. Any good?
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
So what did you do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
He was hot, wasn't he?
What variables?
Well I never did it.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
What do you want?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Mr... Mr. Hand.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Are you ready to order here?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Can we make it?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
What is this?
Yes!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We'll meet in three hours?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I don't think you should...
And the rest of 'em?
What tunnel? Where?
You all sure about this?
Fuck you too.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
We gotta try.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Um-hmmm.
He only shot you once.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
What?
Move it!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Yeah, I'll go.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Oh my God... What is that?
We all have to be strong, right?
I'll do anything to help.
Well...
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Who?
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
But I'll never win that.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
...So what do you think?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
You can always come see it in London.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Yeah.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
How did I look?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's okay.
Mama, what's...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
I think I need a little air.
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
It ain't for lack of trying.
This whole thing is a joke!
You're telling me you feel guilty.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Why... her?
What is this?
You dance so beautifully together.
So have I
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Your decision. For us.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It's going to ram us.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Is that your diagnosis?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
What is your name?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
We should go now.
You want to leave?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Jack?
How come?
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
That was the telephone.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
What about Neddy?
Looks like a storm.
Mmmmmmmph?
You okay?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Just my son and I.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
What's this guy's problem?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
He's my son.
Not a chance.
Who's this?
Auto wreck.
Is this real?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why are you so agitated?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What?
What?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
Sight seein'.
She's in the other room.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
No, I didn't.
Keep your voice down.
You okay?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir?  What did he say?
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
"The Lark Report."
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Time.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Just a coincidence?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
That's not right.
O'Neil...
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
This ain't workin' right!
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Call me Charlie.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Well, I think you're cute.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
What sample?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Are you looking for this?
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need you to trust me.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
What'd they say?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He wants to THINK!?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
Oh.  Okay.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Yes but, we were wondering-
Yes Commander?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
No, wait, are you-
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
As good as Hopkins?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
You're playing your good side.
never doubted you for a second.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Simpler.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Home.
Mathesar? What is that?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Hold course, Laredo!
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
WHAT? WH
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
And a French alliance?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
The army needs you.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Wil...
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No.  I guess.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
We've got powder but no ball!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Oh, come now...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
I... they look both the same.
You must be very rich.
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Just because they are born?
Yes!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
You get the money?
No. What's this?
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Not too bad.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
There's Ilona.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Karen? You okay?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Or else what?
Get in line, bro.
That's right.
I'm a producer.
Something shouldn't be there.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
What does that mean?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Hey, Harry.
It was in the Herald.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
What a spectacular view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
What? You sure?
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What day is it?
Where from?
What is your first name?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
This's gonna hurt a little.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
What?
What is it?
Turbine rotor's shot.
Went aboard.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Morning everybody.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Go on.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
They went crazy.
What happened?
We hit land.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
Of course they did.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
What's this?
Maxine.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Did you actually do this painting?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
I didn't check my messages...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Hey Josh.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Okay, okay!
You can have that one.
Does Oomie really like this show?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Not really...
Just promise you'll do it.
Let's go hassle Josh.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
I didn't get it either.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Just now... I went with Seymour.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
He gives me a total boner!
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
We're not.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Shhh!
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Oh, how "punk."
Fine, and how are you?
That's five hundred dollars.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Oh, right...
Good luck...
Yeah, well...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
What did you tell that girl?
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
You work at Cook's Chicken?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
That's the spirit!
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
No, of course not.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
And it worked?
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Don't much like them.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
What?
But you said they were always old.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
That's very considerate.
But of course yours worked.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, don't you?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
So this is what you do, huh?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Good-bye, Peter.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
These boys aren't playing around.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, I just thought --
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
No?  What do I act like?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
On a purely scientific basis.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Print is dead.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Has this ever happened before?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
What have you got, Egon?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I agree.
She said he was "the Destructor."
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
What is it?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Who was the architect?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Me, too.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
What is that... wailing?
I am their hero!
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Caesar, ignore them.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
God of passages and changes?
I've read of it.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
You teach them!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
You get to come alive again in the country!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Before they leave, get gold.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Are you going to graduate school?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Where is the car?
Wait a minute.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
Yes.
No.
What's the matter?
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
No.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Because -- I am.
Elaine -- I love you.
Did you say rape her?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
What are you looking for?
Are you going home?
What?
When?
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Why wouldn't it?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
No, Benjamin.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes, I will.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
You heard me. Out of here.
I'm in the bathroom.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
The Singleman party, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Where is it?
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Is what a girl?
What for?
But it's light in there now.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Aren't you?
It's all right.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
What are you so scared of?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Yes.
May I sit down?
What?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Are you tired of it?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
What novel did you read.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
What kind of car was it?
I have my reasons.
No.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
But if it's sickening for you --
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
But I don't want you to make up something.
To be what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No. She doesn't know about it.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Quite a while.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Oh no.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
And what are you going to do?
Why?
Why?
Reducing?
Aren't you?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Chasing around.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Am I quite strange to you?
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
So --
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
What?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Anyone asked for me?
Oh!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Dance then? 
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
Later?
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
You're a little too fast.
Miss Flaemm.
Tomorrow morning.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?
All right.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
How clear is Manchester?
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I can't dance tonight --
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Madam should sleep.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Why not?
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
There was -- there was.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I could not think of not accepting.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
No.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
I know.
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
I like those.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
For God's sake, Lilly!
You're getting off the grift?
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
What?
Atascadero.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
What?  What for?
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
That's what I say.
For Christ's sake, why not?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
What?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
I can be real stiff.
Mind if we sit down?
Detective...
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit?!
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Yes.
Just get on the bus.
Where'd you get it?
You look kind of cold.
Looks great.  It does.
What?
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
What is it this time?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
God, what's wrong with him?
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
How all the magazines show tits today.
You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Otherwise, how are things?
I didn't know we had any women left.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You're an imbecile.
Everybody thinks that.
How are you, honeybunch?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Gee whiz--
Life has denied me that thrill.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
College!
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
They're not engaged.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
The smallest thing I've got.
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
"Hamburger Heaven."
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Say hello to your mother.
A trip, you mean?
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
What a honeymoon.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
He knows you shattered his violin.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Rifle?
I mean it!
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
It's always locked.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And her fianc!
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I feel the same way.  What next?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You haven't heard me yet.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I've struck my blow.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
Here.  Finish the job.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Can't do it.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
What's this?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
No.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
In a railroad accident many years ago.
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
Yes, he is.
Then who flushed the toilet?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
What then?
Marry me instead.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
It's true.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
The what?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You know each other?
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
What are you doing?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
No.
You want a tip?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
That's all you got, three girls?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Yeah.
Are you a private detective?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
What do you care about?
I can stop if you want.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Granville?
Where is he?
And better?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Where is she?
Do the police want to arrest me?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Yeah.
No.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Well...
Take it or leave it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Not exactly...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
Check.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
How interesting.
Yes.
No.
All right.
Me! No. Of course not.
Yes. Very much.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
You don't look eighty.
Look.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
The ice is melting.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
But they have.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Just like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Mother.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
This is insane.
A rough estimate.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh sure.
Yes.
Harold!
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's coming.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
Wait!
I... remember.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Do you believe in hell?
I worry about you.
Don't look! Turn around.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Got tired of me?
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
Those things never work. Never.
-- should go back. Now!
Helping you -- I just --
No. I never was.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Hi.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
Help me.
...somebody...
I'm hurting
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
And the blood let you out?
I said no.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
What's the problem?
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
It smells damp.
You're still blaming me.
No. I'm not.
What have you done?
I'm going to throw up.
Larry...
Don't go upstairs.
Not much fun, is it?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Who brought me in here?
I found a room.
You'd like the house.
You like?
I'm afraid it's true.
I'm here.
Oh no?
Oh no.
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What are you doing?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Suck my ass.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Laura.  Her dad died.
Like fuck you are.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Great.  Can I have it then?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
They always seemed...
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Anna.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Pardon me?
Is there a difference?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Huh?
'Morning, Dick.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Rob.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Alright, alright but --
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
I think you know that.
I suppose so.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
You know I'm a good person.
I can't talk right now.
Pig died.
Mmnn.
What do you want to do?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Let's go home.  Okay?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
No, but...
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Just local, of course.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
So?
What's happenin'.
How're you holding up?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
The Conformist.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'll call you.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Seventy-five.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Yeah.
He'd want to know about all this.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Basil the II.
Who?
What will you do now?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
No.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You want me to front for you.
Yes.
They do it each year.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Not the same.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
No!
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
You and I should talk first.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Good way to lose your job.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
-Et lux perpetua-
Aye.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
I'm twenty-two.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
How can I stop such a man?
Go to hell.
Impotent cow.
I feel hardly nothing.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Your name?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Figure she's with him?
Smith.  Carl Smith.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Head still secure to the neck.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
You're insane.
Friend of yours?
What's the point?
I want you to come to me.
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What are you getting at?
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What's this?
What do you want?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
What's the matter?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Then what does he want with you?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Is this the Community Hospital?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
When did you deliver this first?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Anything you want, Boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
They're always after me for interviews.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Well, that about covers everything.
Who locked the door?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
No -- don't out me off.
Shoot to kill, I said.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
And so do I!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Huh?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Hiding him where?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
What's that?
What's the idea?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Get out of here!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Get the cops, somebody.
Baldwin -- his name is.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
The door was locked.
This is going too far, young man.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Bloody.
You couldn't.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
But Dad, It's the News.
Where?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Well?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Is your brother ready to go?
A dead one.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
She's pretty cute.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Quiet.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Fuck your grandmother.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Sleeping.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Don't even say it.
You got to be fucking joking.
You find something, Georgie?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Grampa... watch the language.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Turn up this road.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
That's it?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Aw, fuck.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Say my name.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
I just want to talk.
Please. I look a mess.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
My apologies, madam.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Shut up and tell me.
What do you mean?
Oh?
Please, honey, let me in.
How'd you know where I was?
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
What are you doing in there?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Do you?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
He looks perfectly fine.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
You are an animal.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
I had sold my fucking soul.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Oook. Oook.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Interesting.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Pittsburgh?
Do we need words?
For whom and for what?
I'll make it up to you.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
All I want's the money.
Hey, mister.
I'm buyin'.
Thought you only drank milk.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
A thousand.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
To do what?
Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Seventy-five per cent.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Well, here it's half.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Maybe. You want to play?
The expensive kind.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
HOW MUCH?!
What for? To play Fats again?
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
How much you playin' for?
Couple of bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
What bus?
Have a nice trip?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
You got it all in your head?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Haven't you opened it?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
Well, what's so funny?
Oh, I don't know.
Leave now.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Why?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
That's right.
Your shot.
Thousand dollars a game.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
Do you remember where you lived?
Do you remember where it is?
What do you want?
Have you always had it?
You want me to stay?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
What's that, Dad?
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I was so scared.
I left it at work.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I have school.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Can you believe this?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
What the hell is that?
It's perfect the line is busy?
Nice meeting you.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It's doing what?
Was his father stationed here?
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
We're already over Mach 2!
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
How' he doing?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
And before here?
All your life.
All my life!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
How's the head?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Where did this come from?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Bingo.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
This.
At least I let you tag along.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What do you know about this place?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Rats?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
This is intolerable!
My Diary's in Berlin.
All right Dad -- tell me.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Uh-huh.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
You don't look very good.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Oh really?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Not leftovers?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
What?!
A fulcrum release lever!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Who was it?
Your name is Al...
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Right.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
I told you, my name is Al.
Are you threatening me?
I know...it sounds insane.
Are you crazy?
With a man in my head...
No they won't.
Oh...Gooood!
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
What does it say.
That's not a good idea.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
Eating sushi?
Eat it.
To the hotel. To register.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
But what's it look like?
Which one is she?
Joe, be careful!
No. What will you do.
You been had. We have.
Bingo.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
What are you doing?
I can't see a thing.
Left...The one with the red dot.
He hung us up dry.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
There's a lot you don't know.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
I'll get us out of here.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
They took the tapes.
He work for us?
What things?
Do what?
Oh.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not...complaining, actually.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Where?
Hires you for what?
And you, what do you like?
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
No, he didn't do that.
Hiroshima.
Get us one.
Chiang Cho?
Why not?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
How?
Do something!
Come on.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Why?
It's alright.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Yeah? What for?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Push it.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Shit...
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Uh, what are those boxes?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
...taping?  What are you taping?
"60 Minutes"?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
I got perspective.
...you fucked me!
Is it too late?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
You eating with us?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell!
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, please, Mike...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Yeah... Thank you.
Who's that?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
What do...
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Like what?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
...okay.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Good. But Jeff...
Yeah, great.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
That's not the point.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
Where are you, anyway?
What about now?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Object to the form of the question!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Hello.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Excuse me?
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
But you don't agree?
What is it you're after, Miles?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Have you tried the duck?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Those are gifts.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Hello?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Hello Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Hello, Rex.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
So. Now what?
Do you know him?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
Is this Ming?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
What?!
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
That's delusional.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Nothing.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She owes me a meal.
Extinguish?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yeah.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
You talk as if
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
I beg your pardon!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
I can't go out like this.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Detectives!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I wish you'd stop being playful.
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What's got into you?
was so scaredthat it scared
What?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Clever.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Better go back to your bed.
Congratulations.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
No harm in your coming to see us.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Yes?
What's up?
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Mr. Gordon
Yes.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
ain't got a hat
Yeah.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
There were no phone records.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Who?
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Yeah.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...Oswald?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
I want the truth.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Can we find her?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Jim Garrison?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Never touched me.
How much more?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
That's all you've had all this time?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
That sounds fun.
I know. That's why I went.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Why were you with him?
She knows it's my case?
Can I have a word with you?
My pocketbook.
That doesn't sound dark.
No, you didn't. What branch?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
Somebody loan it to you?
This is pretty.
How do you get it out?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
They seem to like the idea.
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
What do you do when he comes home?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
What the fuck is that shit?
No.
You talk to him?
Not really.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What did you say?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Yes. All those things are true.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I have no idea.
What about me?
What about you?
Killian's.
What were you two fighting about?
Jackie?
They asked.
Yeah?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
That's the idea.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Managers get ten percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Want a hit?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Yeah.
So where did you go?
That sounds like a problem.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
He went to meet that stewardess.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
Whatcha watchin'?
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Maybe the Feds got it.
What?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
What does she do for you?
Was she?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
I'm alone.
In a way, yes.
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
Uh-huh.
I know where it is.
We're back.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You need ... a doctor.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
But the paper ...
How long had that been going on?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
It's good to see you.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
It's freezing.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She was good in bed, though.
That help?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Your kid dropped it off.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Wait. Don't.
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
Don't gimme that.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
While you were in the shower.
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Let go!
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Me neither.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You look upset.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Sit down, Jake.
Where have they gone?
Oh God!
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
So why tell me now?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Never?
I think I'm falling asleep.
How was Palm Springs?
He'll never make it.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
I don't have all day, kid.
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Where have you been?!!
The hull's imploding!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Where is...?
Hurry!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Give me a break! What happened?
Hey.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Push off toward us.
I...I don't know what I did...
You must shut down the engines.
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Barbie from hell...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Almost done.
Ow!
Kay-Em we made it!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
We're missing two of the kids!
What?!!
I gotta go back.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
I never saw one that big.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
He's trying to sink us!
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Got a pen on you?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
Rogue?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Do I set the goddam hook?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Transplants?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Coming right to us!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
I try really hard, actually...
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Nails? Really?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
Junk?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
You do?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Elbow.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Yeah, she does.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Are you takin' the pictures?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Adele... are you serious?
What'll we do out there?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Walter Livesy.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Tight fit.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
How much do I owe you?
This the book your writing?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Yeah.
Why?
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
There's more...
What are you going to do?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
You're clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
What do you mean?
Telly.
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You down with the boost?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I hate this game.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Why I give pennies?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
What are you talking about?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
You know what I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why is that?
I wouldn't believe it?
Telly is at Steven's?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Everything is wrong.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
You are being ripped open.
You didn't?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
You want a wip-it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was... it was.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What do you mean, no?
No it wasn't.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No shit!
Sorry.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
What is it?
Ready for round two?
Why does he call Sanderson?
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
And -- what path is that?
Hello?
Why her?
But you said you didn't know her.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
I've figured out the message.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
No problem.  We're in.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Feeling better?
Why did he?
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
That has nothing to do with it.
That's great.
Same as the others?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Well, I think I've had enough.
You sound like my mother.
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
That's not fair!
You have to win every point, don't you?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Alright.  What about me?
I'm not playing a game now.
Peter...
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Exactly.  It's the key.
You don't understand.
Why?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
I got lucky.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
I lied.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
It should be an interesting journey, then.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
I have a cinnamon bar.
Would you desert your friends?
He will not!
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
I was beautiful then.
Where is he? My son.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
No.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No.
...Not at all.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
The yellow and pink.
What?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...I'm going to kiss you.
Risky business, isn't it?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Nothing, for the moment.
Huh?
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
No it's not.
Are you two planning kids?
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Thank you.
What steps do we take now?
I've seen it before.
You have?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
There's no reason.
Your father?
He's plastered.
I know where my heaven is.
Why there?
Maurice?
Not our problem.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Perhaps there's another route?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
What happened?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
I need your help.
Where did he go?
How are you feeling?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
...Noooo.
Water?
Are you working?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
You OK?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Oh, and what did you do?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I don't understand any of that.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where have you been staying?
Don't hit me.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
It's so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
No.
Did you hear a shot fired?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Who's askin'?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Name?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
You almost had me fooled.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Aside from that.
What the hell is that for?
Whoa -- Why?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Three months.
Why?!
Then we smash 'em?
Birdies... pretty...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
Your love.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You... you're a beast!
And you... are you not also afraid?
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Damn them!
The colt's still too small.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I don't... understand.
Go on... go on...
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
My own father...
He did run?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Tis the truth.
In the dark... where I join him...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Lili... I love you!
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Not very precise directions.
Ask away, sweet man.
As fair as me?
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
In every way.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Please...
Up ahead!
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
In a dream.
Are you going to see Sam again?
Mom said I should.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I'll get your back.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I don't want you to!
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
How old are you?
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Well, it's the least I can do.
She's out with a friend.
Thanks for the shower.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
I don't know.
You don't have a choice.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I'll have to pay him back.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Why would they tow your truck?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
That was the truth.
What did he say?
We've eaten.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
That's the problem.
You don't look like you.
Do you know anything about building a house?
No.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
She's alright, isn't she?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Engagement ring!
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Still got that ten dollars?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
It ain't here.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Yeah.
I said you're soft.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Don't mention it.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Yeah? You and what army?
I'm all right.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Are you offering me a bribe?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Where'd you get this?
He's sick?
Little Nicky.
And he's dead serious.
We could create our own hell there.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
How come you're not older?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
This is bad, Nicky.
Coulda been much worse.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
It's Stanley, sir.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Dude. Seriously?
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You think I'm a tourist?
Really?
If you want to.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
What was that?
Hey.
Valerie?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
From? From? From?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
That was a great shot you made.
Why did you do that??!!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
No.
Jessica.
No.
No.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
A Runner gave it to me.
What're you going to do?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
Will you take me with you?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
Don't ever let go.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
We can't. We're going back.
To what?
Beloved husband...
No.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Can you make it back?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
What?
I like to remember things my own way.
Do you own a video camera?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Can I call you?
It's me...
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
We should stop seeing each other.
What's he do?
Pornos.
Pete... Don't...
In pornos?
Okay...
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
You killed him.
Dick Laurent?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Okay. Thanks.
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Yeah? what did they want?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
No, sir, it's not.
I wouldn't know how.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
We know that.
Who is it?
There's no other bedroom?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
I like to laugh, Fred.
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
When you didn't come to the club.
We've got to call the police.
What?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
What job?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
You like pornos?
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
We just killed a couple of people...
You want some company?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What do you want?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Uh-huh.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Don't call me brother.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
He might have lost his way.
Will you stop squawking!
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
I'm thinking.
No kidding?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Well, that's that, I guess.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Huh?
If you want me to!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
So there are others?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Suppose she should leave it?
Please let me help you.
Yes.
Splendid!
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Oh, stop it!
What's it mean?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George, what do you think you're doing?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
So you think I'm mad?
You're wrong, George.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
What do you want him to do?
What is it?
No. just peace on Earth.
And if I say yes?
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
We wear black.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Gee.  You really think?
Jesus Christ...
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What do we do?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
This it?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Yeah?  What's up?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Agatha --
Please, I want to go back...
Someplace safe.
The other two will die without me.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
What --
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
We know each other?
You set your patients on fire!
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
We won't let them.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
She spoke to me.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
She's a precog?
You're alive?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I forgive you...
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
The precogs were wrong.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Something wrong?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Not if I stay away from him.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
If... you have one.
Who?
I understand.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
What was it then?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
Bullshit.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Mommy's not home?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
But what about them?
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
He making the drop?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
No.
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Yes.
What's that?
Where is the Soho Grand?
It's not losing record.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
You wanna go right now?
Right here's fine.
Pretty nice.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
They didn't say an address?
Nothing.
What the fuck is that supposed --
I don't know.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the hell did you do?
What do you have left?
Calm down.
I'm sorry...
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
So what do we do?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want your surprise?
The videos.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
'Strapped?'
Why? What I say bad?
And where is...?
What do you want?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
The Soho Grand?
You know my pager number?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
She poured it for --
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Where can I get a hold of you?
Why?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
What did you give it to me for then?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
Okay, okay.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I can't.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
What points?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Just hold me.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I'm tired of praying.
Brother Earl.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Just what is your question?
Please, go ahead.
And like a fool I believe it.
I ain't stupid.
I know where you're going.
Let's go.
Let me die then.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
So what about him?
Might be all right.
Are you sure?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I don't know shit about you.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[And?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
And what if amateurs try it?
Yeah, right...
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
We're taking a different way home.
And don't start crying.
No.
It hurts.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
I don't understand.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
You got that right.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Where are you?
Last night. Do you know something?
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
When?
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Waddaya gonna do now?
You want me to ride down with you?
Are you kidding?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Who?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Who?
I'm having a very good time, too.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Nothing.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Put on your blue suit...
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What didn't you like about her?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
That's all right, that's all right...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
What do you want me to do?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Which hospital?
Don't you use olives?
Look at that right eye.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Y'all just act natural.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
People will talk.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
But what about Major Houlihan?
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Look.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It isn't always this rough?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Of course not.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Second pint.
Yes, Reverend?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
He's coming to.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's going on? Who started this?
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Did you get it, too?
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Better let me talk to him.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter.
Oh!
Say that again.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
What John Doe?
Looks all right
That's our man. He's made to order.
Hurry up, Pop.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Duets? But can we trust him?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Colonel!
No.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Sure. Mostly often.
Ba-ll!
No!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
How about family? Got any family?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
What?
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
What happened, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
Who are you again?
Being faxed over now.
Open your shirt.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Only at the very end.
What's the point of this?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
You don't like New York?
I don't really like to drink.
You living together?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
We see each other every couple of months.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Still needs work.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
He's got the girl.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
And what if you can't live with it?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Is the hostage injured?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Yeah that's it.
When?
Yeah.
The hell I am!
Where's the damn wire?!
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And a car.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
How come I can't remember?
Because I took it out of your memory.
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
Guests?
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
It's not real.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
The woman you're stuck on.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
What?
What is it?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Need the disk back!
And it meant something.
I wasn't with you.
What's so funny?
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
All systems go!
Two thirty three a.m.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
GET OFF ME!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And I ain't no nigger either!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
We're asking you to go to prison.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Are you frightened?
So what happened?
And now you have everything.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Who hired the bastard?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
Why? You're the innocent one.
I booked passage to London.
I'm doin' business here!
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
And what do you want out of this?
Wanna know what I think?
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Uhh - martini?
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Holy shit.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
How was it? I don't recall.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Dating anyone?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
You know ...  ... whoops!
What's wrong?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mother!
Really?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
And where is she?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
It was?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What do I play?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
My friends?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Diz--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Diz!
Taylor, my dear.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
He's batty!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Thank you, sir.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Hello, Jefferson.
How's Amos, Ma?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
There *what* was?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Punch?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Tonight.
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
No!
You--don't know it, do you?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Oh--Saunders--
Then you *did* say it.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Joe! You *told* him to!
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
That's him. Let him in.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Good morning.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
No, no children.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
NO!!
Yes.
Huh?
Now, what do you see?
What's that?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Are you? When?
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Last night he proposed to me.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
That's the rub.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
How's it going? Okay?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Newspaperman?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Will you have a cigar?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Nah.
Huh?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Ja.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Proceed.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Farmer?
Yes, sir.
Who?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Really? You think so?
One hundred books?
Doubtful. What did he say?
Dr. Mumford.
I'm fine.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
What's that?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I've had my moments.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
That's a lot of people all at once.
What do you want to know?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What'd you want?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Even if you don't think it's real?
Mom's such a cutie.
What?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Disgusting.
And he's where?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
That's one way to put it.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Hello?
What?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
He agreed?
I understand.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
She's probably ten years older than you.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Goin' somewhere?
Where's your new friend?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
You will not believe it.
So who's the broad?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
You know your history.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm not?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
What do you suppose killed him?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
That looked rather painful.
Um-hmm.
Do I?
Much less go outside.
Come on, baby!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
But you're a superhero.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Have you considered my offer?
Superheroes.
Are you with me... or against me?
Who?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I admire you.
What's your real name?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
But there's still only six of us.
Cover me!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So why don't you just tell her!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
We're superheroes.
Not yet.
Really?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
But... the silverware?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
That was too close.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
What do you have in mind?
Properly arranged, yes.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, sir?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
The first reports came in at about ten.
How did it spread so quickly?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Lisette.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Were you in love with any of them?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
You couldn't face telling me what?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Do you like music?
Yes, I do -- very much.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
You paid cash?
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
You straight?
What?
It works.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Here I come!
What's the matter?
All damn.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
What is it?
What was that?
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
What?!  What that mean?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Get on.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Take your car.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
I have a problem.
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Where did you get these? Who are you?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
What...?
Keep your voice down.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Can we go now?
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Keep it.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Who?
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
He never told about the money.
What do you figure he done with it?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Yes! Yes!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Bluebeard!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Pearl dotes on him.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Are we goin' home, John?
Up river.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
It -- she --
Yes. Yes.
Yes?
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
I was praying.
Do you want more children, Willa?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
You'll whip me!
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
Now who was this?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
What the hell's going on!?
No.
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
No.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
My dream.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
She dreamed this would happen...
Sure, but...
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Screw sleep!
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
No more fights.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
An evening gown.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Or it might be the firing squad!
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
We had to take it on account of the safe.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I guess it is eight forty-two.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
We can call our ambassador.
Leon, my little boy.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What did she say about me?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
What's new?
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
You, please.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Suppress it.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Do you hear that?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Probably not.
Yes.
You remember this room?
I promise... I swear.
I don't think so.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Comrades! Good people of France!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
What does he say?
Huh?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Yes.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Yes.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
We could check the tape again, sir.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
No, we have nothing to hide.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Yes ... I got the money.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
I like it.  I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
This is June twentieth?
The army?
That was civil war.
What's Liddy got?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
How?
What about the documents he promised?
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
What ... ?
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
And me? ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
What?
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
We took his system out.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
The White House.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
That'll be the day.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Jesus Christ!
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Use his women.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
We got the press this time!
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Sir?
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Is that the truth?
Are you okay?
You personally?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Thank you.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Lost.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
The "crises"?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
I am older.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
You're discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Don't get hurt.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I ain't got the money.
Just keep it up.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Promise?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
What makes you say that?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Did you go up to his trailer?
...You need to talk to me.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
This. And the gas.
With anything?
You live in that house behind the store?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
One room, one night.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
That's me.
I know how he found me.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Why would he go to Odessa?
Yes sir. Two tours.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Oww! My arm, careful!
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
"Banners?"
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Umm, I don't think that...
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Umm... yes. Back home.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
It's all right.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Ad lib?
I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
You made out alright.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
You're hurting him!!
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Where are you going?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
I don't follow...
No...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
No.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I said 'got it?'
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
What'd you get her?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
What did you say?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Huh?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Okay, Everett.
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Ass right.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Helluva idea.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Don't I know it.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
A million dollars.
It was a moment a weakness!
Who's the honcho around here?
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Come back here, kid!
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
No, sir!
No, sir.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What other issue is there, Sid?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
What?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
How did it go with you guys?
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
Jets.
You okay?
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
Th --
Not that one.
They're not supposed to be here!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
No fucking way.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Something's weird.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Well, I know that now.
That room!
It doesn't work?!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
I heard you.
Yeah.
Got him!
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
What are you doing?
Blue is phones?
Call Dad!
I'm sorry.
Why?
Huh uh.
Where is the Glucogen?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Yeah, it's me.
You know it. Stay Black...
...Glad you came man.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
We need money first...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
My Mom's at that.
What?
Rose?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I expect to try.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
You got me beat on both accounts.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
That is a separate issue.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
If I fail, you fail.
Perhaps.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
And the Governor?
Did your father teach you humility?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
That's right.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
He left us.
You don't hate him.
Please.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
A long time ago...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That bad?
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Father?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Yes, but the rope might be--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Nice.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
What do you mean?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
But--
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
My God!
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Louis, are you sure?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
How does he do that?
Aye, aye, sir!
Elizabeth goes free!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
Wait as long as you like.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Then why aren't you eating?
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Come on!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You cheated.
No.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
'Bootstrap?'
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Jack!
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Yes.
... No.
He may be.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
He's still breathing.
No.  She hasn't.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Poppy, please --
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
What did he want?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Susan!
When did you...?
The big house?
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Mouse?  What mouse?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Look at this!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
The nanobot... it's not here...
How far can you stretch?
No cheese.
What's that?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Will you step into the library?
Oh, Mother!
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
What are you talking about?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Mother!
I knew your managing editor very well.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
Who are you?
Quite so. Quite.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Thanks, thanks.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Hey, Gallagher!
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
A statement? Good.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Hello, Smith.
Surely, come right in.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Double-strength!
But I
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
That's puttering, sir.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
I'm sorry ...
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Really Biff? The keenest?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
What'll it be?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Well--it was dark out ...
It's like the basketball team.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
The other one?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Get lost!
I don't know.
Noooooo!
You know him?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
They don't have that kind of potential.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Keeps going ...
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
I can't.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Look ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
How long do you think you've been here?
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Oh, hi.
Free?
Cool.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
So it's ok if I bring her.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Yeah I can't.
It's not cool?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Really?
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
No.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hello?
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
-- you said you did.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
No.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Hi.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
This is funny.
How long have you known her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah.
Is everything ok?
Nothing.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
yeah.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
For work.....
Yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your name?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
337.....I'm sorry....
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Can we agree that that is that?
Mhm.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Hey.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I won't.
I know.
Ok.
I know.
I'll see you there.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
No.
It's fine.
He did seem a little strange.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Once or twice.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Madeleine --
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
It's not even noon --
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
They can't be serious.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
AND DID YOU?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Well...?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
And my own.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
...yes, I've got that bit...
-- words alone are insufficient.
How was I to know, my darling?
Doesn't that please you?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Sure
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
So I've been told.
Do you?
How bad is it?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
Sir?
We're using-
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
He personally asked you to?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
It's 350 pages long.
It's good, huh?
So they're Jews. . .
Is that from one of the Gospels?
Shit
May I help you?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
It came.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
They've all seen a rough cut
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Orson, you wanna take five?
Oh, no--
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
And where you goin'?
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You know?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
With her? How?
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Nah, she would never...
What did Tommy say?
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Screw you, Jack.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Should I hit it?
Who asked you?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
You asleep?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
What?
What are you doing?
He should.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Feel a little foolish?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Jeff -- huh?
I can't do that.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Did you ever own a saw?
Your Lisa?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
For what?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Like what?
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Hello.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
No.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
People have different emotional levels that --
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Thank heaven that's over!
No.
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Who's Thorwald?
Not too active.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Yes.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Maybe she died.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Someone not his wife?
What doesn't?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I have the whole weekend off.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
How?
Machismo?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Mother--
You make any sandwiches?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Will you wait a minute?
He depended on me.
You don't?
Have some cigars.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
He's just loaded, honey.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
What?
I'm here.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Man, you're schizoid!
I'm here.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
My gun?
Do I have to spell it out?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Okay--
Plato!
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See, I'm new.
They'll be looking for you.
It doesn't matter to them.
You cold?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Why?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
To all those cons...
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
We sell children's toys --
Yeah.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
...the truck driver...
Nick, no --
Nick, please, it's me --
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Jack. Jack Bangs.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
No!
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
What?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
No, you can't --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You what...
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
A station wagon in Canada.
At least gimme video poker.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Get in the CAR!
Take 'em.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
I can't go back to Vegas...
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
How do we take them out?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Hell you haven't.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Don't move, Rudy!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Do what?
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
That's what it looks like!
Alone at last.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Bullshit.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
How can you tell?
Me and Mr. White?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
You gonna put it away?
What's she doin' now?
He don't believe in it.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Why?
You didn't ask.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
It's not good...
I can' take you to a hospital.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
No real people?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
I got the diamonds.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
No shit?
We can't take him to a hospital.
I don't know anybody.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Maybe he did.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
And this is Helen Carter.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
I suppose it is.
I'll make the soap myself.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You're not going out to look for them?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
It's going to Sonora.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
That's right.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
How'd you happen to miss?
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Finished, son?
I don't care what she asked you.
How's that?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
That sure smells good.
I like it.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
And we're running out of that.
Would they be good to eat?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
She was only teasin'.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Are you okay?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Ouch!!
Cindy, what's going on?
Hey, you left your book back there.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Cindy, let me...
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I know, but I've been thinking --
What should we get?
It's okay.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
What the hell are you doing?
Yes, we made it!
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Professor, I think you should see this.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Because she will lie?
What?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother? 
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Detectives, what is this about?
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
"P" as in...
Hello.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Who wants fruit salad?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
And who may I ask is Carl?
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
I'll take this instead.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Where?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
How much does she want?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
I don't know.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I can imagine.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
What was she to you?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I think it's time.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
What?
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Because I have something very important to do.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Yes?
That was quick.
Graham is an unusual name.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Sister older or younger?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Kids? What about them?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Impotent.
Does it bother you?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
You went out with her?
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
How did you know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What do you have to do to get ready?
I have money.
Tell me your name.
Is he going to see this?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
How come?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Not entirely.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I can't tell you like this.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to touch you.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Why don't I believe you?
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I want out of this marriage.
Where did you go when you left here?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What do you mean, like physically?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Not really.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
And what?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
What!?
Did he touch you?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
And you ask questions, right?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
I want to see you.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
What's so stupid about it?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
Student?
Will you lease month-to-month?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
No.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
He didn't make it.
BREAKING OUT
How's Brad?
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
You got it!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Absolutely correct.
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
BRAD!
Flavors!
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Why are you being so defensive?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
How's the trip?
Are you there? Miles?
Gary.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Say, is Maya working?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Hiya.
No, I'm an actor.
I am one of those guys.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Um... seventy... something.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Shut up.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Count me out.
You should call her.
Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Fucker hit into us.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
Come on, let me drive.
Look at this!
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Twelve months in oak.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah? Like what?
Good. So did I.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hello?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Sir, what are you doing?
What are you thinking about?
No.
There's dust in it.
It tastes funny.
You do?
Curse and stuff.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Where are you going?
Should we turn off the lights?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
They're distracting us?
It's getting stronger.
They're broadcasting...
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
Graham.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Dad.
Where are we going to sleep?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What was the first thing?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
It's like War of the Worlds.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
...And you had to kill him?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
What friend is that?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Kate?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
Offend anybody lately?
No, Leavenworth.
Going to Turley, was it?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
That's a lie.
Never will again.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
What's all this then?
Hello, Rae.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
What do you mean?
What makes you say that?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I don't want you to get hurt.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- What's wrong with that?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
You're not renewing my contract.
Why not?
She'll drive herself.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
There isn't one.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
She doesn't want pity.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
Excuse me?  Start?
My two favorite girls.
I just read somewhere --
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Yes, call me Simone.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
Who are you really?
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Body double.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
-- We call them "vactors".
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
You know, I... don't know.
Can't you stop that?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
One thing bothered me.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
You know me -- married to my work.
Really?  Too bad.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Is it a jamming device?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer...
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Thank you.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
...No.
I don't know, Cole.
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Where is she?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I don't know how else to look--
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Hi.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
He means moon shining.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
What's wrong?
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
...no... Mac... p-please...
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Looks like a chipmunk.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Flip.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
You got my barley pop?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Yeah?
And?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Yes.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Bandit?
Yeah?
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Never mind. It's nothing.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Talk to me.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Oh.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Who?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Are you on a land line?
I'm not doing cocaine.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I am. Yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
A million flat.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
What's the time frame?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
How much sleep do you need?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
I wish you'd told me.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
What is it?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
What happened?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He has a point.
No.  I love you.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
He won't do it.
Gibarian was under enormous --
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Straight ahead.
Right.  That's true.
What did he say?
Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
But "nice".
You put me life in danger.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop being nuts!
Where?
When can I see you?
Claire...
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Mike?
It's not your taste.
I had to follow her to a store.
Why?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you watch?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Yes.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
No, I will not step outside.
You should'a brought the girl.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Under the table.
How are things going, pal?
Mom and I got plans.
She's what?
Shooting?
And Flash isn't?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Oh, sure.
Cause if you get in a bind--
See?
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Don't be pitiful.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Can we make it a hundred?
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
He knew.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I've gotta study.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Do you mind if I come too?
Peter?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
You sure about all this?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I'll introduce you.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
So they're airing this tonight?
What?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Say, Schulz --
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Let me go!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
You did?
She'll never forgive me!
That's what I wanna hear.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Do Grable.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Why the south latrine?
Says who?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Go on.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
What time?
Ich weiss alles.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data, are you all right?
What do you mean?
What?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Left behind?
All of us.
No, no. Thank you.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
A photon torpedo?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
David, I don't understand...
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Later. Let's go...
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
You would have done the same for me.
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Wait! Give me a chance --
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!

Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Share this with no one.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
That's all you have to say?
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
The Admiral's son.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
Time's up, Admiral...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Just barely, sir.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
What IS working around here?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Very well.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Time from my mark...
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I can't get power, sir!
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Fire all phasers...!
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
Fine. Just fine.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
What did you say she was getting?
He's coming 'round, Jim...
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
... I don't think he understands...
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
No, <u>my</u> name.
You play games with me and you're through
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
You mean man...
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
How will that be done, exactly?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Where could you take them?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's that?
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
You tricked me.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
What are the variables...?
Explain.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Yes.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Ready sir.
Systems report.  Communications?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Two?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
That's the ticket, laddie.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Sulu Hikaru.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
You have warp capability?
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
... an offlander?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Captain, Geordi...?
Incomplete, I might add.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
You're not going to launch anything until...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
You got me, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
How long has he been unconscious?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Vulcan?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Juice?
Where?
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
No... the door's too thick.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
ATR setting...
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
No. It's a lot further than that.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Return to our own time?
Report!
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Even Data?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Are we playing multiple choice?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Spoken by you?
Well, I -
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
But if she's cloaked...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Aft thrusters -
Captain, our shields -- !
Sulu!
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Captain...
The peace conference.
Why would they give them to us?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Uhura?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
A lie?
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
I think  not.
Nevertheless.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Do you know who I am?
Can you remember our father?
No.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
A bit less florid, Data.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Negative.
Why?
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
It's you.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
No.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.

With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Not very chatty.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Yes.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Yes.
You're not Reman.
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
And what of the Enterprise?
Its too late.
I am.
So theyve got him up and running.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No deal.
Mrs. Haydn...
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
What?!
Eh... police.
What?
I am husband?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
You want to try it?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
A baby is a new person?
Why?
What is hitchhike?
The driver will...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Go?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
Do you have music up there?
On the radio they say it's good.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
What?
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Was there visual contact?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
You saw that?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Hello...
We can't let you do that.
No problem.
Fuck you.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Can't do it.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
That's not sayin' much.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
I won't say anything.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, Lenny.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
How's Zander?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
You never told me.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Are we under arrest?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
You're thinking...?
Agent Mackelway.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Dylan here.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Look...
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
The tattoo?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Agent Mackelway?
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You knew it was me all along?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
No.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Yeah.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
How was it hard?
To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
They're out of Glenlivet.
No.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Oh my God.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
No...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Well, I should be getting...
Hello?
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How are you doing?
You know, us.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
It's a gig.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I don't talk about her that much.
How many strokes?
I'll give you an eight. 
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Him?
Thanks, man.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
VEGAS.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Whu?
Cut that shit out.
That's not cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
I know, but...
Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I don't know...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Don't remind me.
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
It's on.
Which one?
What are you doing?
What a surprise.
A day.
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
Bitch... You little bitch!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Oh, it's on, baby...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Sue...
It's on.
It is on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
The bear's got his claws back.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
No.  You ask for too much.
What do you wish me to do?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
I'll think about it.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
No, I wanted other things for you.
What is it?
How do you know I come from America?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Give them some money and send them home.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Was there a definite proposal?
Jesus, I don't know...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you wish to be baptized?
He talked to you?
You straightened my brother out?
Uncanny!
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I love jazz.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
What?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
What does he say?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
So tell me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Dickie?
Who is it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
What about Christmas?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Mr Greenleaf.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
He hates being confronted.
Marge, when did you get here?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
What?
Very.
It's all true.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
My God.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
My name is Travis.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Keep it.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
You forgot "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
More people watch it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
This I gotta see.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
For a fee.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
You carry a piece? You need one?
That ain't much of a name.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
But that one night?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
God, you are square.
He shoots dope too.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
There's porno theatres for that.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Your name Sport?
I'm here to see Iris.
Yeah.
Neither do I, I guess.
Spit it out.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'll go.
What, vou?
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
You've got everything?
I wish you were coming with me.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
I think  it's worse  now.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
How'd they get it inside?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
I don't smoke?
They're not bad.
My what?
Thanks.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes... yes, I do.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Yes.
But what?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Good to meet you.  Again.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
And... what's my name again?
Ernie.
Ha!
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
I... no, I... I just can't...
What's wrong?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You kids off to the dance?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
No.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Ancestors?
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I suspected as much.
What do you mean?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
Look.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Cathy!
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I don't know yet.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Right across the bay there.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Oh. I see.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Yes?
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Did you close the door?
Not by the thousands.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
He's not home.
Well, where did he go?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Lovebirds.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I think you're a louse.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Can't see a thing.
Right next to the one you already had.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Without any clothes on?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
So you didn't go to school together.
What did it say?
Why?
You have a job?
Like what?
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Are you staying?
Of birds?
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
The bay doesn't.
Have we still got power?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Have you got a pencil?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
But Richardson?
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I thought this was a school day.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
But why, Gray? Why?
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Nearly a year.
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Two down. Two to go.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I don't know you, man.
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're him. Corvis.
Someone else did it.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's ok, it's ok...
Erin. Who?
I know.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Anything wrong?
You're in with them.
Please. Come inside.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Is it real?
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Where are you going now?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I -- I thought you were--
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No. That's all finished.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Would you like to sell it?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Why not?
Two down and two to go.
We were gonna grab some food.
Don't!  Stop!
With him?
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's not glowing.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Still mad at me?
Tell them to get something to eat.
You've heard this story before?
Lights out, Sam.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Does it burn?
Star.
Now you and David...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Why not?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
What would that make Mom?
What do you want from us?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Finish what?
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
Was dark... find a light...
But...
What clothes?
What for?
Spaceship of some kind.
Neither will we.
Anything?
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
How far's that?
Right.  Why not?
Where were the flashlights?
Why?
You jerking off or just pissed?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Now how did you get hurt?
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
But you're only a mud carrier.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Vox?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Alexander.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
A man can change his history.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I know.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
What?
Dance with me...
Let's walk through the park...
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
You wouldn't believe me.
Oh, that explains everything.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Someone you loved very much.
Kalen...
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Yes, sir, he --
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
And roosters.
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
What do you mean?!
We choose to believe it.
Then it's time to change that --
I'm fine.
Then don't.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Relax.
That's too bad.
Yes.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Why, what would you do?
No. I don't want it to.
Well, what time is it?
What about the world?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
You still don't believe me, do you?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
What were you talking about the other day?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Where are you going?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Uh-huh.
Darryl.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Alright.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Good God.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Hello...
Who is it?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Front.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
That's puttin' it mildly.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
I want you to call Darryl.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
No.
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Now what?
You're a good friend.
Yeah... sure did.
What?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Stop it!
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Nah.
Yeah, right.
Why not?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's so funny?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Huh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
'That right?
Healy you dog!
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Oh yeah.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
-- He's in a cage?!
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That...? Vestibule.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
You're a movie buff?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Fuck!!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Uh-huh.
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Jai alai?
Among others.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Four.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Oh. Well I am.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I'd go with the seven.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What...?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
Get over here.
Shhhhhh!
One guess.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I want an hour with him.
Forget it, Scotty.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
I was eating that.
No you weren't.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
I don't like what's happening.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I don't want to listen to this again.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
You crashed my file?
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Who is he?
When did we get that?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
What are you --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
What was he saying?
So what?
I don't see the connection.
That's not solid.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sorry.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Jesus. Oil?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
What about the water...
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
How the hell do you know?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Yeah, most likely.
Yes, ma'am.
Two.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Make what?
Anything.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Come on.
I want it understood.
You don't have to do this.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
What?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Well... What   is   it?
Yes sir.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
What are you doing?
Not anymore.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Well what?
What do you want?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
No shit. The Iceman....
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
What the hell is this?
I'm pinned to the panel.
What'd you do?
ON THE NOSE?
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Figured it out yet?
Nope.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
I can take care of myself.
Then why are you here?
You may not think so, but you are.
You think I shouldn't fly.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Need a ride?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Would you like the same suite?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Your sexual orientation?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
What is it?
Where?
Where's Kuato?
They found us!  Everybody out!
I don't know.  Maybe.
Let me buy you a drink.
I want that fucker dead.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Quit while you're ahead.
Lori...
--I got a trip to Mars.
I'm not your wife.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Doug...Bob McClane.
I'm not interested in that.
This is too weird.
She wasn't really my wife.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Where's this "reactor" come from?
...Who are you?
Ready as we'll ever be.
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
And I appreciate it.
Ready?
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
He was your snitch.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Not at all --
Of course.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
So what're we gonna do?
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Let's get a cab.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Figures.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
About Chinatown. What went down.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
-- How could I help you?
See-cil.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Y-yes, sir.
Shu Kai Kim.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
Shouldn't one of us...?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No.
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Well, where are you going?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
OK, Gordon.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
What is it, Gordon?
What?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Someone else has it now.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
Ever see her with someone else?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Agent Desmond, it's...
She lived alone.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
No, you should forget about last night.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Nice night.
Maybe.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
We're on our way, Baby.
What about tonight?
Oh, Laura.
When he finds out.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Trees?
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
When's the next business trip, big fella?
...tell me about this case.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
I...
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Just as you are, Sir...
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Objection!
Huh!
Say it.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Thank you. When Debby...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
What is this going to cost?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
...I made a reservation at...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
I read the hospital report on your client.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Hi.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
I object, your Honor...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I've got to work...
Isn't there something you...
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
No... no...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...I understand...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
...he's a good man...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
That's right.
Yeah. I'm awake.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
The broad has disappeared...
...four years ago...
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I just saw her.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Should I?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
They've blocked it!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
How'd you guess?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
So?
Yes, but...
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just be careful, okay?
Chase, you'd better come home.
What?  What kind of episode?
Yes.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
What?
no.
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Finish, please!
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
What...what is that?
I'm fine.
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Fred Krueger did it.
Yes.
I want to see the body.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
What's that?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Then what is he doing?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Your father?
What?
Guilty.
Why did we begin this?
We were idealists.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Well, that's all part of it.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Albatross?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You know, I never had friends like this.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Why'd you do it?
What's the difference?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
You all right?
Well, spit it out.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
I should be eating with the crew.
Yes sir.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Don't ever call me stupid.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
No, sir.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
This be it?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Ready for another?
What's she doin' here?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What is it, Johnnie?
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
And you never told nobody about it?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What kinda trash talk is that?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Who do?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Uh-huh?
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
You must be my son.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Mama???
Just a place.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Course I am, mama.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
No.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Tripp!
He has a book.
He is. Take my word for it.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
That was good.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Who do you think it is?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
I passed out.
You did.
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
Her dog, yes.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
No. Sara, you don't understand...
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Oh.
That's a big book you're writing.
Hm.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because of my coat?
You're lying.
I'm sorry.
No thanks.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Yes, Hannah?
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
But where? I need the street.
Professor Tripp.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
Easy there.
Hm.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
You heard? How?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Oh?
Inside.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
He told me.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
I told Walter.
Did you just make that up?
That's a nice greenhouse.
It's Grady, Walter.
No.
Is it good?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
As a heart attack.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
What made you pull out that old thing?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Hardapple?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
What?
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
When can I see her?
I've got some good news.
It's not what you think.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
You don't know?
It's not for sale.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
The one with the ax?
Why's that?
Yeah, like the bird.
Robin?
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
That's right.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
We have a few more minutes.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
You don't know!
What did you want to happen?
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Go home, Walter.
All right.
Nothing.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Time.
What picture?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
You're quiet at work.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
They could eat you.
Why do you want to know?
So, you're not a dyke.
What's the problem?
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
What did you do to them?
I've changed.
You know, this is crazy.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
No you don't.
What?
Live together.
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
You see where it's coming in?
How?
We've only got one suit.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
'Fish'?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
He can still make it.
What kind of light?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Yes.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Good night, my love.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
It's divine!
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
I'll stay here also.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
Ettore...
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Why don't you try?
Don't you ever paint men?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And what did they say about me?
We have a radio like this, too.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
And do you remember where she got off?
Are you the owner of this place?
They didn't seem too good.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Why?
Why?
It made them holy.
No.
Who?
Right now?
Who?
Oh, yes!
Yes.
At least once a week.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I got sicker.
From God.
Agnes, how are babies born?
You liked Sister Paul?
How did she know that?
Is that what she said?
She can't hurt you any more.
I'm afraid.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Yes.
Doctor Livingston.
Why were you afraid?
Hm hmm.
What do you do?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Yes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Stay away from me...
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Martha, it's you.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
What man had access to her?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
That's ridiculous...
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
That's absurd!
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
It's my affair too.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
There's another choice.
What?
Do you know what she did to her?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Because I didn't know... 
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
For Agnes.
The father!
This is insane.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Did you know she was pregnant?
Too late for what?
The baby?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Sure.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Me? Why?
You do - repeatedly.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Of course I can.
Yeah, grotesque.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I don't care.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Gerron.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You can learn from books.
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
What's that mean?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
No, that's his other one.
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
No.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
What?
Hello.
Oh yes.
That's what you tell me.
Is it? Is it really?
Don't exaggerate.
Aren't we ...
He belongs to Paul.
But...
Yeah, you want to watch it.
It's not my fault.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Hell, we're equipped --
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Don't you remember?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
How long to fix?
<u>He</u> died.
What?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Hey, guess what?
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
It's over, Hunter.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Oh my God.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It will be.
I've completely lost their signal.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Recognizable!  In that?
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
First contact...
What's the frequency?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
What'd he say?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Martin?
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Would somebody fill me in?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
What is it?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Minh...
You win some, you loose some.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
What?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Hold it, hold it...
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Okay.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Seltzer?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Do you believe him?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
It needn't be.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
It wasn't meant to be.
What time?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
... and Karen.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
She was magnificent.
Margo? Lunching in public?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Take care of yourself out there...
I'll try.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
She did...?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
That never stopped you before.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
- guilty.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
The audition.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Groom.
I just asked a simple question.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
She's loyal and efficient-
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How long does it take?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Eve... don't cry.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
How'd hear about it?
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
It doesn't matter.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
I just can't believe it.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Where is she?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
You'd have been proud of her.
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Answer my question!
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
All right, what do we know?
--what do you think?--
Goddamnit--
When?
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
Goddamnit--
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
You overslept?
What does it say?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
Morning or night?
I'll never get out of here in time.
Well of course.
--that was awhile ago--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Where are your bills, Carl?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
What do you want to know?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
So?
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Haldeman too?
How grand?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
But it's possible.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
...go on, go on...
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
What did you just say?
...okay...
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Just go!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
You don't like it?
What?!
How did you know I was here?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
You want onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
You're missing the game for us?!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
What?  We both have cars.
No.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Like a bet?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Hey, minuteman.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
You can do that?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Oh, Kev.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Ready for what?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Merde! Just missed!
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't know...
We don't both have to die.
God. I can't believe it.
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Andy!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
What did she say?
What were you showing her?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
I shant!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
What happened to your parents?
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
I'll show you!
I had nothing to do with it!
What's your name?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Well...
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Okay.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Duane?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
M'hm.
Yeah.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Mine.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Are yuh?
Well, what is your definition of following?
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah?
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
It's for my complexion.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Commentary.
I can't.
What-
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Forget it, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
His wife has diabetes!
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
It has your ring.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Why didn't you bring him?
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Why would she care?
Really.
So where is young Jonah?
Let's get the kids.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
That for us?
Sally?
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Just did.  Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Escape hatch.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
We live next door.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah...
Anytime, sport.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
We're great.
What?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
He'll find his way back.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
What are you saying?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Yes.
Will you make love with me?
What's a sign for that?
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Don't I find what?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Uh-huh.
A little out of my element.
What am I, five?
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
God willing.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Yes.
Is there space here?
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
How?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
Thanks.
You're my best friend.
I don't mind...
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
I hope they're watercolors!
Yes.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
And Cal's this massive adult?
I don't have a drug problem.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
Break's over.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Well...  I declared war!
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Out here I'm just what?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
May I cut in?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
You're a real buddy.
Sheldrake?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I think so.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I don't understand --
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
A bad insurance risk?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Why not?
Do I have to?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
Oh.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
How's everything at the apartment?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
You do?
Where is your apartment?
Yes, sir.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
No I didn't.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
You can't come in.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
How do you spell her last name?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
No kidding.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
What for?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Yes, I know.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I don't believe you.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
I have that date -- remember?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Where do you live?
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We need all our fuel anyway.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Winning the war by yourself.
Rangers, eh?
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Cook school -- that did it.
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Not a thing.
What'd he say?
Shot himself. What for ?
Get in there !
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Listen.
What is it?
Anybody see some smoke ?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
American weapons?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
I met him.
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Do you?
This one , Lance?
You think he'd of shot us?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
The other one --
This boat's a mess.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
His name is...
I'm sorry to hear that.
I should be checking on the boat.
I know.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
30   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Where'd you say Eric is?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
New to the country, kid?
Surviving is what I know --
Sounds like professional jealousy.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
You know Meyerling?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Told you I'm fine!
You don't feel cold?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Shut up!
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Since forever.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
No.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Carol the waitress?
I want you to go on this trip.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Thanks, Melvin.
Nonsense!
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
I'll take you... why not?
What do you want?
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
You know what? I...
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
How to die, mostly.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
What the heck are those for?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
About a dog.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Yeeeess!!!
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Where are all your queer party friends?
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Another place where?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Absolutely not.
What?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
No fucking way.
I ain't scared of you.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
What?
Sick.  The flu.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I bet you fucking know!
Twenty large?  That's all?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Nikita?
'Them'?
Until a minute ago.
Because he is trying to retire me.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
It's not the same, is it?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Ahhhh...
Why not?
Yes.
Are they usually like that?
Hey, where are you?
That's where he'll be.
Yes.
No.
Where did you learn it?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Two way?
Check.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Ten years ago.
What did he say?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
That's a ridiculous move.
It happened to you before?
When did it start?
Martin.
Okay.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Hi.  Did you call --
Do you ever think about starting over?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Why not?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
You mean quit?
You wish to close this account today?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
So how's your work?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Fifteen crowns.
An alternative literary venue!
Like Custer huh?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
He was an electrician?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Well, don't get carried away.
But how did the wall get here?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Close!
Perfect!
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Why don't we go together?
No, the boyfriend.
It just happened.
Tell me some bad news?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Good morning.
Yes.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Sure. Excellent.
Turned Czech huh?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Can we charge admission?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
How?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Why are you doing all this, what for?
I had it coming from someone.
Run into Josh?
And you broke into that room?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
I think we should be going honey.
What for?
Shall I look after the rest?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
With you.
I'm sorry about how we --
Kelly wouldn't do that.
'Bout what?
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I meant he's a doctor.
I don't make small talk --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
I know. Don't say anything.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
You're really into God, right?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
You don't believe in anything?
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
We're doing something -- ?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
What do you actually know with religion?
Come on.
What would you do up here?
When did you build this?
I've talked to your father.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
You're in the play?
Yes.
I'm no dummy.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Please.
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
Thank you.
So what did we just make?
A similar triangle?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
But he didn't ask me.
Hi, Marty!
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Fine..
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Operator...
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What? 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What did you do to your hair?
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Okay.
What you been doing?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Then why'd you do it?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, stop the world.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You tired?
No.
Everybody loves trout.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
What's that?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Just gimme a chance.
Hi.
You tossed my hat out the window.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Where're you goin'?
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
It's too dangerous.
What's his problem?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
...I know this must look... funny.
Let him go.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
What DID you mean?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
What do you do far a living?
To see pap.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Nope.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...Yeah, okay.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
How did you know about that?
Yeah, but 
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
We gotta call the police 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...I just don't know what... to do
Sure, Charlie.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
All of which he's now missin'.
He teach you to do it?
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
All night?
When did you start drinking again?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I had him in two classes.
I'm De...
How long were you having sex with him?
Are you arresting me?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
There's a name from the past.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
What's it about?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Why take the risk?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
What did he say?
How'd you get in here?
No.
Really.  What are you writing about.
I finished my book.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
What kind of drugs?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Was she ever a suspect?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
What are you doing here, Pop?
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
I'm a painter, too.
I don't know.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Cool.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Really?
Paint it out.
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You're shattering all my myths.
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
I guess it was a long time ago.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Don't you think he's using you?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Me? Why?
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
You like your dad's paintings?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
I didn't know.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
And the truth frightened her?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
You buy this "blurry" business?
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Working late?  I'm touched.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I am as well as can be expected.
What is it?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
What are you talking about?
Alfred's happy here.
I'm afraid to ask.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Mr. Freeze.
Watch the first step.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
She knows who we are.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
The _Rolls_?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Mystery.
Up here, Al.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Wait. You can't go.
Nostrovia.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
That kid is amazing.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
But...
What?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Bruce, you can't.
Edward...
Paranoid? The psychotic?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Where's the boy?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Take me. Let the boy go.
I know. I called them.
What about the girl?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Finding out where she is.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
What are you, scared of heights?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
How'd you know it was me?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
What were you thinking?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
HOLY SHIT!!
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Jesus.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Here, let me do that.
Annie, it's me.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Bye, Dad.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
Yes?
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
What's gone?
What?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
That was boring. Huh huh.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Well where is she?!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
I see it. I don't get it.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Cool, huh huh huh.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
You got two seconds!
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Two hours.
I don't think we survived the crash.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
They make gypsies look good.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Where are your skulls and bones?
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
What happened?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
What is going on?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Our cemetery?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I... I don't know what your name is.
God, you're anatomically correct!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
I cannot believe this.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Okay?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
They don't want to come down.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
It's fine today, Robert.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
My name is Chance.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Thank you, Eve.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
Do you like it?
... Are you sure you like it?
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I understand.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Bravo!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
No, Ben.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Oh, I see.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
I see.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
You're welcome.
I hope so.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Compensated...?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes. I will.
Try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Good night.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Right, Chief.
That could be possible...
Malkovich.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Maxine...
Simulates?
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
That's the usual?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Can I be anyone I want?
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Fork ah did?
Thank you, Floris.
Do you dream often?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
We have to meet.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Great then.
Come on in.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
I'm getting better all the time.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
I likes yellow.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Don't pay to complain.
Your mother all right?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
May I come in?
Ya think?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Morning.
MAMA!
She likes this dress...
Was over to Baby Suggs.
He's sleeping in the church.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Her who?
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
You planning to do anything about it?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't believe that. I won't.
You don't know what I think.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Sethe?
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah, it sucks.
Nothing.
Can we just rent it from you?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Sheesh.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Nancy's pretty good.
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Excuse me?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Oh, no.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Yeah, but what about--
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
That's really thoughtful but I--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Oh?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
What if it's during a game?
The what?
What the fuck is going on there?
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Wooden bridge, huh?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
What's mine is mine.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shit!
Dude here.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Employed?
Ah fuck it.
I don't know, sir.
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Well?  Aren't you?
Well. . . yeah.
Oh, shit.
Am I wrong!?
Impressive.
What is it with you people and pain?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
For what?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
What do you think?
Thought you were dead.
You want me to hunt them for you.
So you're going to do this?
We're locked in.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Tell me something, Skid --
The hell are you fiddling with there?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Don't try to talk --
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
"The Blood Tide".
It worked, didn't it?
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you doing?!
There is no cure.
Graffiti --
I've been better --
Is it bad?
I'm not leaving without you.
How's it going, Kam?
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
This isn't human blood.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
We keep in radio contact.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Yes.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
What's she look like?
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--<u>myth</u>--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
What?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Are you marked like this??
--like you hurt the baby--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
I don't think it was them.
I don't know yet.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
The witch?
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
What movies?
Me, too.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
How's she going to know where to--
What the fuck--??
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Enough to keep sane.
--it's less than four feet, just--
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Jesus.
What?
Sure. I'm sorry.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...You ever get tired?
...Ray?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Uh-huh.
...You know that car?
What "what"?
...Anything else?
For the money.
...What did you do with the bodies?
That's not the point.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
What day is it today, Angie?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Frank?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Don?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Yes, I like you.
I made it go down the toilet.
Do you know?
. I. uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
You like to open me. don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Do you love me?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Here's to Ben.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yes.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Where are they?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Yeah. but.
Are you sure?
Okay. thanks.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Yeah?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's okay.
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
uh uh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Where do you guys want to count?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Tuna, this is crap.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Why are you speaking?
Excuse me?
What the fuck is that?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Just a friend.
I'm calling it three.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Surprised to see me?
Barbara.
It would be my pleasure.
Un sapo?
Yes, it is.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
I'm sorry, George.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
Give this to Mom, will you?
How are you doing, George?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Look what the cat dragged in.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
You can call me Dad if you want.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
Because she's visiting me.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
I understand. What's your question?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
So -- where do we start?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Why?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What'd he die of?
What can we prove?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Can you?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
I've got work to do.
Objection!
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Intense.
Why do you think she left you?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Why?
Did you suggest any?
-- And what did you suggest?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
I was angry.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
I heard him say it.
Yes -- he did.
No.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
P.M.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
What would?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
What?
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
You killed him -- didn't you?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Yeah.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
I can back it up.
Really?
Can't it wait?
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
Please -- not now.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
No treasure maps, huh?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Roseman Bridge?
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh, that's nice.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
Francesca?
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Why doesn't it scare you?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Yeah. It could get better.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
'Bout 4:30.
Apparently just before her death.
You people really don't like dogs.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Let me see your hand.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
Have you ever been inside?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
And you believe her?
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
I can't.  Not yet.
What are we doing down here?
But --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Not that I remember.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Caesar!
I can't.  I can't.
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
They just left, didn't they?
But it could be anywhere.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
We were in a car accident --
You know he would have done you, too.
I should be going.
Okay, sure, Mick.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
I knew it.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
A beer?
Curious, maybe.
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
No.
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Five years is a long time.
What?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
We're not that different, Corky.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Then what?  Exactly.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah, twice.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What time did you say they would be there?
Any bodyguards?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
I'm just asking, what if?
Thank you.
I won't.
I was so afraid you ...
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
No.  We can't risk it.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
What do you mean?
Treadstone?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
You have your passport?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Who?  Who came?
Really.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- forget it --
Stop where you are.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
Sir...
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
...ervices.
...your ducts?
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Er ... Thanks ...
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Long time no see!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
So how ...?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
We don't make mistakes.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Stamped?
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
It's heavy.
Really.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
Leave me alone!
Information Retrieval.
I never signed the form.
You want to take my console into your office?
Yes.
You haven't switched it on.
Lime, I need to use your computer
I'm sorry but ...
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Yes?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Have you got one or haven't you?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What the - ? How did you - ?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
No, no, that's impossible.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You know each other a long time?
Mary said you might be coming.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Dead.
No. He's dead.
You're not going to die.
What did you say?
Oh man, Bucky.
He's very very sick.
At least he's got people around him.
Our Lady of Misery.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Don't seem so bad to me.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I need to sit down a minute.
Who is it?
I think the worst is over.
He got better.
Would you like to come in?
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
The brakes are shot.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
That's ridiculous.
Frank!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Don't push it, Larry.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
And the rule was...
Wait.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Hi.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
What happened?
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Do you feel good about it?
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
Don't go.
What?
Yeah -- being a basket case.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Let's go...
Yes.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Almost immediately.
Yes.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Play back the last line...
Yes.  That's right.
What?
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Go ahead.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Hey?
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Billion.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You okay?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
What?
No.  Were you going to you?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
Yes.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
Are you okay?
It's kind of dark -
See you later -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Walter!  Jeez!
It's true, isn't it?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Are you alright?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Would you pose for me for free?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Dead Cat?
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Well...why murdered man?
You didn't mean to what?
A show..how soon can we go?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
Why not?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
You don't have to do anything!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Figures.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Thanks.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Bugs.
) What do you think?
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Same one.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
I wish you would.
Vampires of the world, beware.
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Interesting.
All right.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
What... are you?
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Got that.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Big League pitchers don't use these.
How ya like that?
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
We lost.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
You're pulling your hips out.
Damn.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I want to be had.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
What's it say?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
God bless you.
Which one of us?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Beg me!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
I was great, eh?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
No.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
Crash Davis?
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
We'll pray anyway.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
What'you want, kid?
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Stop -
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
She's not here, Sam.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Hello.
No, no it's okay.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
...to me.
Why?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
What are you -
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Back -
You never - ?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Why not make them happy?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
Right?
You sure?
It's chinchilla.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Okay.
Yeah.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Yeah.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Why do you want to do that?
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Not gonna let me in?
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
But it was just mine.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Eight children! 
Well...
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You gotta go back out there.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
You can't talk to me like...
Sam?
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Fucker!
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Now move along.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
He's gone?
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
What're you gonna do?
I know.
Are you sure?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Yeah.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
Okay.
Nothin'.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Yeah?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Hm.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Yes.
All right.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Okay, then.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Smarten up.
Get up.
Stacy. 
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Take it easy!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I know, but that's enough.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
You're kidding.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Hello, Spooky.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Good morning.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Maybe.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
Was someone in an accident?
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Are you guys all right?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
You never miss a trick.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Who?
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Hey drop it, okay?
Pictures.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
What's happening?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Yes?  Yes?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
It's locked.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
I thought it was inspired.
Who's in back?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
A typical fuck-up.
Why are we stopping?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Took preparation.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
What time frame have you got in mind?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Sure.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I still don't see you.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Don't worry.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Yeah?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
There's no lady here.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
How?
See that, Col?
Saw that one.
Maybe he wants something.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Don't be like that --
It's him, isn't it?
What's that supposed to mean?
Guy I work with.
You American?
That should make her happy.
What was that?
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
No --
You want to know how I kissed him?
I think you do.
Want to look after you.
Why?
No...
Come on, Dil --
You mean that?
You think that's wise?
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
It's a secret.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Jimmy?
No.
I suppose I tried.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Fergus!
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Eddie and Tinker died.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Thanks.
I told him.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why?
What?
Why do you want to do that for?
You sure about that?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Thank God for that.
Good. So what do you think?
So it's on the street.
This is a farce, man.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What makes you think that?
What the fuck am I doing here.
Shouldn't take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Fergus?
Yeah?
Who's Dil?
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
When I was a child...
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You won't run.
What you say, faster?
What?
The teddy bear?
Don't run off, Jude.
Not here.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I heard you, I heard you.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Barely, yes.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
That's the spirit.
Yes -- ?
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
No.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Not my room!
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Okay.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Why?
Alex --
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Meaning what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
He was American?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elyses"  Why there?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
Up there! It is up there!
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
How do you know?
What are you doing here?
You mean you and me?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Do you know what's wrong with you?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
What?
Go on.
That's all.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
What'd he say?
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
I don't see him.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I never fucked Rod.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
is there anything you do?
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
You were eavesdropping.
Are you sure?
Well?
What are you doing?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
I know where you're going.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
I am.
Mark Shale.
You eventually have to talk to him.
No! That's his table.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
This place is empty.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Did Sharon say no?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
Ok.
...shit.
A little early for a delivery.
Oh...
...-ty.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since today.  New policy.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
For cryin' out loud.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
...up.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...

Okay.
Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 

 Okay.

You okay?
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
 Gee, you think so?
Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
Hey!
Okay.
All right.
 Listen!  Listen...

Oh, shit!

And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
So you took his...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Hey.   Mason.
...deal with this asshole.
Arlo, shut up.
Whoo!
Oh.

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Look out.


You did help a little.
I think so too.
...-tiatin'.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Oh!
I feel faint.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
We're worried...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
This country trained me to kill...
What?  Say again...
Exactly.
Doc-...
...-tor Long.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
No!
Andrew...
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
All right.  After they put you away...
Do you know what'll...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
It's clean.
Check the immediate area.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Where's their protective...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Is this your establishment?
...dangerous.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
 

...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Ah.
No sign of 'em...

That little geek is my...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Mason.
And what if it does?
...-m-means, Mason.  
Yeah, I just....
Dr.  Long!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
...you answer mine.
I didn't sell the boy any...
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Look at that.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Thanks.
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Just find the girl.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
What's that, Curly?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core club.
Looking for someone.
Where?
That's it?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Yes.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
K... Cross.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
And Hollis knew about it?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Hold still. Why?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
What did he say?  What did he say?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I can't...
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
I have to go home and get my things.
...where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Of course.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yes...
Well, no.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Since lunch.
Yes. No.
Yes.
They were partners.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Not exactly.
Why? What do you mean?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Thanks for all you've done for me.
But...who...
My husband...you know him.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's the matter?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
And the notice?
We haven't heard from him.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
What's the matter with you?
What's funny now?
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Is that what you want to do?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
What?
Why, Brad?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Yes.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
I know, but -
Yes, sir.
He married you, didn't he?
Well, if it's already too late...
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Can I watch?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
He went home to change for the big date.
You're kidding.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
I just told you.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I'm just kidding.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Just me.
We did.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You're late.
What time do you have to stay till?
Eight and a half.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
What's that?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Can you believe this?!
Helluva game!
You know what Sanford told me? 
Julie Dwyer died.
What!?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
You were saying?
An embolism in a pool.
Broke his neck.
I could never reach.
What, your dick?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Five hundred dollars.
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy to get a fine?
I'm not. She just left.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
You didn't have to choke me.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
One seventy-nine.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
It's not my store.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
So.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Lasagne.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I touched a nerve.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
No; who were the three, besides me?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
What do you mean?
Yeah, right.
Well...?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Sure.
I don't want to go back with her...
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
It stings a little.
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He only speaks Russian?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I think the lady called it.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
She's losing it!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Look, I know--
I'm going with you.
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Can I count as fast as I like?
That's it, you look like a professional.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
You can stop right there.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Yeah?
Can you see light?
We might be able to go that way.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Who's going with you?
Right.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Richard Travers.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Great, sir. Great.
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you still feel suicidal?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
What crime did you commit.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Thank you, sir.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
Helping you, sir?
Keeping fit then?
Well - I'm back.
I'm gonna be sick.
I wanna be sick.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Yes sir.
Lice?
Through there for a bath.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Are you referring to the background score?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
I just say what the other person would say?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Like what?
But not now?
You need a vacation.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I picked up a tail.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
What thing?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Not our call, Phil.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I was just tryin' to...to...
First time in New York?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
You - you killed him?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?
South Central.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Are you breathing?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I need the job.
Yes, Max?
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
You go every night?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn't cover everything.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Some living.
What's at Union Station?
You're full of shit.
None of your business.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Max?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Why the hell not?
Mississippi?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
What was your horse's name?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Shoot.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Is he dead?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Now what?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
He gave it to me.
At a horse show.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
They'll trace it.
I'm sorry.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
And what did I say?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
We've lost contact.
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Ellie...
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Are you threatening me?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
No primer.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It's beautiful.
Can't we get rid of them?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Why did you contact us?
Many others.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
No more stalling, Captain.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Jesus --
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I don't think so.
Really.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What...?
I'm sorry.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Here, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Hey, Tattoo!
Borrowin'.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Stop that.
No. No chains either.
Now look what you did.
Fear of what...
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
We'll get the paramedics...
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
In jail.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Why should I trust you?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Maybe you should...
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
The lock...
Is there a phone booth there?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
I like women like that!
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Look at her legs.
What's Abba?
Right.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
We were together six years, sir!
Where were you?
It's about time.
It is?
You should have gone to the funeral.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
No. But when he's in that car...
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Please finish your story.
No.
You could get your wish at any moment.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Yeah, everything's under control.
You look beautiful.
Really?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
But what am I going to do?
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I'm only looking out for you.
Honestly, Letty.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
I'm really not that hungry.
Letty, you should be in bed.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What if it's got a pattern?
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I have a terrible confession.
Michael, I...
Not a one.
Just checking.
Furnished?
I love the pillows.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Michael.
Good luck.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Yeah?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
You don't have a fever.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
No.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Office work?
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Do you know who this is?
A pass.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Good.   I'm good.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Uh, no --
He missed three weeks.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
For what?
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
What for?
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
They were all French guys.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
I see.   A master criminal.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
We've got to get out of here.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Yeah.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
How do we know what room she's in?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
You're not helping.
J&amp;B?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Something like that.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Who's gonna see it there?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Who are you?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
What's it to you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're already a thief.
I owe you nothing.
How so?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
They forced me to marry!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Give it back!
Let's stop a moment.
You coward!
I don't take orders from anyone.
Go.
It has.  How's business?
No.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
I'll look around and catch up later.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
But don't be too lenient.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
This is a delicate matter.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Care for a hot dog?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
They couldn't do anything for me.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Who?
Mister Funboy lives there?
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know you.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Cute nickname, don't you think?
Yes.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
I've got him if you want him.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You talking to me?
What? Another letter from your friend?
Shut up.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
You're naked.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
That's none of your business.
That's also none of your business.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Okay?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
I do not.
Lighten up.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
I just came to say goodbye.
I think that's for the best.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
I love you.
But you knew this was important to me.
German.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are the boys like?
I'm in the bath, mom.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Okay.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
But I thought high school is only four years.
I look terrible.
I like it better when I'm on top.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Hi, mom.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes!
Where is she?!
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Sorry.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You can put it anywhere.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I'm at your service.
Have you succeeded in your task?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Morning!
Exactly the opposite.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Some other time.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
She's not here.
She's out.
Annette! Annette!
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Oh, hello.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
What's her name?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
What do you mean?
I'm never unfair.
What's funny?
I thought you were with Amy.
Certain wishes do.
It was on account of the birthday party.
And who did the voice belong to?
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Just you wait!
But there's no one here, darling.
Yes, darling.
I've wanted a friend.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
It stands so still.
Yes, Amy.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
No, thank you.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
What?
Does she have PMS?
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
I don't know.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I think she broke the skin.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Hey, did you get contacts?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
And then?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Are those Mark's?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
I've been here. What day is it?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
And he was missing an arm.
Get rid of him!
Why not? There's been a murder.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Mark.
On your desk.
No.
Are you following me?
Like what?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Uh.... hi!
What happened?
What's that supposed to mean?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
What's with the squirt guns?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
You at least owe me the truth.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
What are you talking about?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
They don't speak English...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
You typed this report?
Im sorry...
Why, yes.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
But...  How long has this been happening?
You see it?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
What does she say?  The woman.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Known me for long?
Horrible...
What are you doing?
You've been working too hard.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
What is it?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
No more than the usual.
You're kidding?
A month.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Mr. President...
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Oh... I'm fired?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Nightmare...
Just don't call him, Alan!
Bob...
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
I was a senator, you know.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
You're kidding.
I'll lock him away for good.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
A teleprompter.
Thanks, I wrote it.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Perceptual?
Fertility beads.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
How'd you get started?
You're not?
What?
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
I was waiting for that jack.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
Are you hungry?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
I know.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
TONY....TONY....
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Step up here, Tyler.
Tricks...Jesus...
Sounds boring to me.
How was dinner?
Well?
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Yes sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
You what?!  How did you do that?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Don't stop.
Stop what?
Hello?
Well, sure!
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Chris!
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Dead Poets honor.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A yawp?
Yawp!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Okay.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
You really think I should forget her?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
What is this, a midnight study group?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
What?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Not an option.
That's where my boat's moored.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
What?
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Me??
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
It's okay...come on...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
A little to the left...
I have been.
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked you?
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Here's to huntin'.
I thought that was it.
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
I got delayed. I --
I have to go.
Where is he???
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Yeah?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Sal.
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman!
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Naw, it's... I mean...
No-o-o!
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
I'm just so lonely.
I... No. You do this for money?
Merle?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Huh?
From Nam?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Then lemme have 'em.
No!!!?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Never one.
Down.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Funny guy.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Give it to me.
You're working a partner on this.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You're crazy.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Just great.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
She's pretty.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
I'm here.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Yeah.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
You could always take it off.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Belle --
Gee -- that Fair --
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
No. She's gone.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
No, you're not.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
The seventh day of April --
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
You know darn well it is.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
But -- I was just lucky.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Your butter money?
Not all of it?
Tired?
Mary --
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Mary --
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Mary! Come back ...
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Hello, Sheriff.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I can't be honest with them.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
The past six months.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
John.
How about his job?
The code key, please...?
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
What are you doing?
...I've missed you.						*
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Hello, Sonny.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I'm sorry...
Why you going to Algeria?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... yeah!
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You try calling the police?
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
They're okay.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You tryin' to fuck me?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
I must of been outta my mind.
What's the matter with you?
What if I take you with me?
Special to me, too.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
You all right?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
How did you know your son was involved?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Where's the money?
Goddamn women...
You mean that?
We won't have to.
All right ... send them the guard.
What kind of a deal?
Sonny -
Get over there!
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What's wrong?
What can he do, he's clean...
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Morning.
Hello?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
<i>What is it?</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Talk to me.
Yo!
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
It's been about a year.
What can you say?
You're a drunk fool.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
I'm coming.
No.
...peanuts.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
I'll do.
C Duracell.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
That's my name.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
You keep it.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Then we'll do something else.
I don't know.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Take it easy, Pop.
Oh my god, are you alright?
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
HARRY!
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY? Are you okay?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
The principal.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
You're not my real dad.
No.
You're it.
Owww... refreshing.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
I kinda screwed things up.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
George Washington!
Are, too.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Cute puppy.
Well, I'm listening now.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Right.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
I thought I told you to get lost.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Special Needs class.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
That's my boyfriend.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
God, I've missed you.
And...?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
So, this is Leto the Just...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Don't touch my mother...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
THE PAIN!
What is it?
What can be done has been done.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
I never said I could ad-lib...
Eddie, you screwed up.
But maybe not.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
But there's plenty of other parts.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
But you used to say --
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Um, I guess --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
You look beat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Huh?
Well you tried --
Who's Dr. Tom?
Let's get married.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
I'm really sorry...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Yeah...?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
I thought this was a group effort.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
So?
No, uh...
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Leave her be.
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Both.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
And what did he come back now for?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
What's going on over there?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
What does this mean?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
You batted or you bunted?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Okay ...
Well, when you put it that way.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Where?
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
Where were you?
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
All right.
Polish acrobat.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray --
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah.
You know what your problem is?
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
We have to stop meeting like this.
Mm.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
What does that have to do with... ?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
I know.
Thanks for everything.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
What is it. Tammy?
I did it.
And how did you get in the school?
Door was open.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
What do you mean?
I also like bananas.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
I'm not like you.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What do you want?
How's the left these days?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
What work?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Yeah, that's Stens.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
What about him?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Against your code?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Whose shoe?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Anything?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What are you talking about?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Not good enough.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Some reality.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Under the house.
My daughter was a virgin!
What's he doing here, Sid?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Have we met before?
Something like that.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
I don't know what that means.
You've got it on tape?
I'm doing a transfer now.
What kind of a question is that?
A direct one.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
What if--
Did you call anyone?
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
You're driving.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
So what do we do now?
Well then who can?
What are you saying?
Is it okay?
Is that good?
It's a little late for that.
Pardon?
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Did he give you anything?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Just for the criminals.
I saw a man die.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
You <u>swore</u>!
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I know, but listen--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Who?
Sir?
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Who's doing this?
I know.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
I can't.
I've never met him?
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
What's his name?
Mr. Dean--
She can't talk to you right now.
Why?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
You gotta--
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Tell me about it.
You think there was a connection to--
What happened?
What about the tapes?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
What about--
Federal Express?
Now is that clear?
Daskylus
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Which stall?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
No.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
No.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
What else?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Don't talk.
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
What kind of photographs?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Have you seen Katharine?
I see.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Okay.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Is this you?
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Where've you been?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Where did you find that?
Hello.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Right.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Excuse me -
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
You'd better be.
No!
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Is something funny?
For my hair?
You get Hardy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Of course.  When?
I'll always go back to that church.
He's gone, hasn't he?
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Only we have to go to work.
A bit of one.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I'll come with you.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Mac's signature.
You don't call, you don't write.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I've got something...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
You can't.
Oh?
We going somewhere?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
You stole my luggage? You--
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I didn't mean to get personal.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Charged?
You were afraid of heights?
Terrified. Still am.
Aren't we all.
And--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
It's a party.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
Your share.
We're living history here.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Oh my god, I thought--
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You shouldn't have.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Jesus.
Hang on.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
Gin, really.
In the van.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
We're supposed to.
You damn well thought wrong.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Jesus.
How does someone get meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Right.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yup.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
What are you doing here?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
This is the only thing you found?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
And that's what caused the contamination?
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I want my fucking money --
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
How dare you take that away from me.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
How do you know that?
Have you been to the water board?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Annabelle Daniels.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Ten?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
What're you doing?
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Keep your voice down.
That's Ed.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Hello?
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
What's going on?
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Who's Baxter?
The boy is our last hope.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a blue streak.
Barks his concern.
Barks a doleful farewell.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Sit down, and shut up!
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
We?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
How do I look?
That was no earthquake.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Probe?  What probe?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Repairs ...
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Hyperdrive.
Get out of here, Lando!
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
It's a lovely outpost.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Jabba the Hutt?
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
Do you have a name?
Believe what?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
With food?
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
What?
I need a favor.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
See you in hell, Snake.
Shut up, Plissken.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
So what does this thing do?
Where are they going?
Who?
Who?
I cannot--
When you threw it in, what did you see?
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
At your service, sir.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Father...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
Who is, then?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I'm going.
There is one.
Me?
The law forbids it.
You are truly magnificent!
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Where do you want this?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
But it's clean?
Yes, I go now.
How are you today?
Is it coming out Willie?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Could you see her?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Oh look at that.
You know how?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
How do you know?
You just missed them.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You speak Latin?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I'm all right.
Oh really, when?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save your servant
Have we met?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Unlikely.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Sick priest, is that it?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Miss?
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Sometimes.
I don't know.
It's my goddamn car!
Take it now.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Trunks?
Well, look at this.
They gotta go.
How many?
Get your hand off me.
Don't make trouble, all right?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Why the interest?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
We don't get a gig.
Terrific.
I'm not unhappy.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here!
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Right.
Good idea.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Because I can hear it.
Funny, huh?
The Royal.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
February?
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
I don't know.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
I didn't hear you come in.
Right.
Yeah, fine.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
I'll take the Mallory.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Spur of the moment.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
I'm sorry?
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Changed?
That!  You can't wear that!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
What do you think?
They're tight.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Great?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Got another song for us?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Thanks.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Where's egghead?
Huh?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
You're upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Nina?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Losing his teeth.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How'd the show go?
From Hurley's?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Where am I?
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
No.
How come?
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
Now what?
Stay away from my family!
They're too tight.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
What are you -- stupid?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Commander, what are you doing here?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
-- Yes.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Excuse me?
Why Jack?
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
But I think I like you better this way...
Who did?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Miss me, Jack?
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
How much time?!
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
I dont think so, thank you...
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
Are you okay?
Why not?
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
Jack...can we afford all this?
And now...?
This place is a perk, Kate.
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you okay, Jack?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Hey, are you okay?
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I had it at four.
Are you alright?
We had a tough year.
Ben --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What?
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Me like-y.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Leonard, how's the feed?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben did this.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
For science.
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
What are you doing?
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Why didn't you say something?
It's just business.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
The less time, the better.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Wish I knew why.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Thank you for saving my life.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
What happened?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Where's my daughter?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't know. Few munce.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Personal matters.
Oh, geez.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Both of these.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Just a general way.
Uh-huh... A what?
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Yeah!
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Hon? Got the growshries.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
...There's a million dollars here!
No, see -
Mm.
Call 'em up.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Geez! You look great!
No, no, that's fine.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay...
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Linda.
The day of our homicides.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
They're real good.
Yah.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
What... ?
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You are a moron.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
The dynamite...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Can't you give me something?
I'll expose you.
I want brain parasites.
Looks like this is goodbye.
This could go on for hours.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
I don't know ...
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
There?
No... no problem.
When?
I don't know.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
What?
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Who's this?
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
No, supply oxygen?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
I guess so.
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Would that be a problem?
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
But a good strange.
Call what off?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
What is this place?
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Look...
What?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
Stop finishing...
I quit.
Tyler...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Do something for me.
What?
Appreciate something.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
You were there?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What do you want me to do?
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Shouldn't we pull over?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
This place?!
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
4:25.
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Get control of yourself!
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
What's this?
This place is a trip.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Where did you find this clown?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Look, Co...
John.  My name is John.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
You pathetic scum.
Christ almighty.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
I know.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
But now it's free, right?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well there....  What's the difference?
How much?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
The Little...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Do you follow her every day?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
It's such a great song.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
Twinky?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Cerveza.
You can sing the song.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I know you're not.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
No.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
Who?
No. How much do I owe you?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
How long have you been staying here?
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
I think he's got a terrific personality.
I guess you fell in the water.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
If you're free.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
What?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
What?
What?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
It is true.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Look at me.
What?
Then don't go out with me.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
Remember me, from the pool?
Nothin'.
You know somebody around here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So what's her name?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
My friend told me she lived around here.
Unbelievable.
That's what he said.
Sonofabitch.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
That's two.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Funny old bird.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think Id rather have drugs.
Can I get you something?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Are you serious?
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Read this, please.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Then he has.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
They busted me last week.
Fletch?
Why not?
Alan Stanwyk.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Why don't you try suicide?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Yo!
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Thanks.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
You were in the war?
Can I ask you a question?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Who.
What are you talking about?
But I've seen the deed.
What are you talking about?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Who?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
Who's your decorator?
Excuse me?
Actually, you may take it all now.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
So you...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
You going to be okay?
You okay?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Who cares?  I got a case.
I'm sorry...
I tried to help you...!
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Well, hello, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Only on a first name basis.
Hi, private eye guy!
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
No - no.
Everything is everything.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Got a wife named Angie.
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
Pour moi?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
We must follow it.
It's beautiful.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Yeh?  Who else?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
What about Sal?
Same car.
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
I been damn careful up to now.
What are you saying?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Yeah.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Damn.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
No.  This isn't what you think.
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
How's that?
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
You ready?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What'd you just say?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
I lost you.
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She just died, your mother just died?
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
How?
What are we like in...1998?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
It's not your fault, Dad.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
In my pocket.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Huh?
Huh?
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
What're you gonna do?
Which one is it?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Could we move a little faster?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Yes.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Is that all you found?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
But, Dad, we...
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Well, let's hope not!
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Look --
I gotta get back to work.
Jesus!
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Get up!
That's very colorful, chief.
Her name's Stephanie.
Why didn't you tell me?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Don't do anything stupid.
How many times do you want to hear this?
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
No thanks.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Right.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
But I thought...
What's that?
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you talking about?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I...I can't...
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
When did this start?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
I heard you weren't coming.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
She wants a divorce.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
I say we go.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
Where is it?
No, we're not.
Of course I saw it.
Does what feel comfortable?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
It's your best play, Nicky.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
That's always been my problem.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
It violates so many trusts.
People are dependable.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
What do you want?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
What am I doing?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
Why do you care?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Yessiree, Bob.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
What's good?
And he has finer moments now and then.
I hear good things about the new play.
The fact is, I have to get going.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
What do you want?
It's beautiful.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Who is that young man?
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
What a pity.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Something's not right.
Jerome--?
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
What about this?
You had to be a right-hander.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
The Mission Director.
You wish.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
A day or so.
Call German.
In a corridor.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
Anything I've forgotten?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
What do you think?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
No.
Why would we do that?
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
My medication.  I left it back there.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
What do you add up to here?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
We'll try again.
What do you want for dinner?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
You were asleep.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
For exits off Main Street.
At least you were outside.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I don't want to go there.
A man helped me open it...
When we had trouble before it was different.
You've got it all figured.
I don't want to hear it.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
You're crazy.
Where do we go from here?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Where?
Suit yourself.
Then you do it.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
Two years.
I got a nurse in mind.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Yes.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Where's he living these days?
Nicer than most.
Oh, do you?
We went about together.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Tell me about the girl.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Nice of you to come.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
No. It's all right.
Sorry about your father.
How's school?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, what for?
Don't know.
You work here, Keith?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Right.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Where you off to?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Ta.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
You sod.
What you going to do?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Nasty way to go.
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You did?
Some contest board...
It's not.
That's right?
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
He is?
Yes.
You...
You build it!
Somebody...
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
No.
Did you talk to Graff?
You're saying "me."
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
That's right.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
It is dead.
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
He said we...
Why don't you think so?
No.
Did they catch...?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
That they're going to be upset.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
What about the other two?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...you talk to Murray...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I will close.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Alright.
What are we going to say?
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now?  Now?
Can't do it.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
What are you talking about?
You robbed the office.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Was it?
Abso...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Just now.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Uh...
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
What?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Lingk.  James Lingk.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I don't understand.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
No.  She told me "right now."
I don't have the power.  I said it.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
I have the stuff from last year's...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
No, where is it?
I'm not hungry.
We have no money for a rug.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What is it?  Can I help?
And you believed that story.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Why?
Within the compound will be fine.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Mikey, I hoped...
I took care of it.
Where's my brother?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
They are everywhere!
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
No strings.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Kay.
Why don't you sit down?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Where can we talk?
Right here.
Yes.
This doubles my investment.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
How is his health?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
He don't want to talk?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
The same assurance we got from you.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Thanks, doll.
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You did not know?
No!
It's not what you think.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Mornin'.
Nice place.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
What?  Oh yes.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
No.  I'm fine.
Your family ate dripping?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Did anyone laugh?
No.  I could have, though.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
I never thought you were.
Do you miss it?
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
Not fear.  More like disgust.
No harm done.
Neither of us really belongs here.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
The Great War?
What happened?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I'm very sorry.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
So it is going to happen after all.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
She is horrible.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
One likes to live simply.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Then the rumors are true?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
I think about that night a lot...
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
I'm just here about my brother.
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
And this has what to do with me?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
Double-meaning intended --
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
What about him?
How you know that?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
You goin' home?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
Come here --
What?
What for -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
Cut 'em...
Hear you roar ...
What happened to Sway?
So she flies -
What about me?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
What did you hear about that thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Nods.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
What are you gonna do?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
What are you talking about?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Where's the stuff?
I flushed it down the toilet.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Jimmy.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
How?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Done.
He heard.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
But, Paulie, please.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Oh...
Hi.
Okay.
You caught that, huh?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Did she get my Double Burger?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
What's up guys?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
You want us to give you cash right now?
Good, it was all right.
Seven.
Yes. Under two conditions.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
--that?--
I don't know what it's called.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Well, I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Sean.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I've been busy.
Why me?
My kind of background?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
He married his cousin.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
I don't know. India maybe.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
What places?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Probably not.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Why thank you.
No.
Fine.
My wife's dead.
No, I don't.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
What?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
You want to read it?
That's what you want?
I kind of got that impression.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
I have twelve big brothers.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Do you keep in touch with them?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
How the hell did you do that?
I've never seen your place.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess so.
What?
Yeah, but how do you know?
I can't go out to California.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, I do, Will.
Will ya look at her!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Short fella. Pale face.
Joad.
How many men?
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Excuse me for asking.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
What's the matter?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
This here's a strike.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Since before they stopped us las' night.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
You can have this for ten cents.
Which ones?
But who done it?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
I wisht it was day.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Please don't.
Now you done it! You busted it!
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Oh... really?
You do not.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
I just play my own collection.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Bad experiences.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Yes.
...About five years now.
Get the fuck outta here.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Come on.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
I work alone.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Hello, Bob.
Lisbon?
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
He using her.
I'm not happy.
I have scruples. Next.
This is not good.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
He sold me this bad boy.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Doesn't matter.
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I have a way with animals.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Did he mention it?
Yeah, you know everything!!
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Yeah.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
It's so cruel.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
What was it like?
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Diane!
Ha...
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Would you let me ride your horse?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I wouldn't let happen.
I can't... not yet...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's warmer than I thought.
I thought your mom's coming up?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Did you notice -- no cane?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
You ever miss it?
It's cool!
Secret Service!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Right.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
And what's he do?
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
Revenge.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I told you, I don't play well with others.
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
I found it! I found it!
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What?
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
What?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
There they are!
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Gill.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Yo, what's up?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hello?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Congratulations.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
What?
What's going on?
Not without Jamie.
You guys always look great.
Found it.
I do.
Watch it.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Who you calling?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Dad, what's going on?
Why?
You knew. You just didn't care.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Do you?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
It's been totally charted.
Look.
Look where?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Yeah.
We're all alone, aren't we?
Ten minutes.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
They could be.
I don't like that story.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I see.
It means... I see.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
And then, uh, April...huh?
That's disgusting!
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Could you--
Like, uh...?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Where are you headed?
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yeah, you would.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
I'm...all right.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh, yeah.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Oh!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
But it hasn't been forever. 
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Why not?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Hmm?
Me?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
What are you going to use for money?!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
But not you.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Yes, please.
No.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
This is the second opinion.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Perfect!
Don't you think she does?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Uh-huh.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Can we, can we go?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yes, you do recall, right?
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Why are you so upset?
And?
It wasn't my day.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Why me?
...why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
You want to get married...?
How crazy is that.
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Impossible.
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Seen what, sir..?
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
No. 
Yes sir, I saw it. 
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waal...
What'd you say, hon...?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I require...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
And you let her get away.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
...may be the heat....
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
...which of us is free...?
The girl needs help.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Every suicide kills two.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Why?
Give me your gun...
...my love...
I am on the track of...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Thank you.
I know it well.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Your Secret admirer?
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
You should grab her and shake her                           ] and tell her it's a goddamn war out                         ] there.

We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?

Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Gee, thanks.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Things are going to change, Earl.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Do you take German?
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Did to.
If you'll excuse me......
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How was the funeral?
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
But my name's not...
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.

wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Hello!
I just want to be on my own for a while.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
I'm educating myself!

Look, Mother!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
It's so beautiful!
I shall call him Diello.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Of course, yes.
The way you just looked at me...
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
No.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Must be nice.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
How much time off?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
That was cold...
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Thanks.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Ambulance.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Underbelly!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
You never saw that picture, huh?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Gale...
John, I know all about it.
"A little mistake"!
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
She's talking to him now.
What?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
And the rent is okay?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
No, no, no, no.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
What happened?
About us.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Mommy!
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Did you hear what he said?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Oh -- great.
Do you remember who gave us this?
I hear things in this house,
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
What?
Oh God.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Shit!
What did the thermometer say?
Promise?
Would you?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
What?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
I hear you.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What worries you?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Your life.
I cannot stay.
Why?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
A lucky guess.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You're twenty minutes late.
I'm just trying to place you.
Yes -- it is.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Be careful, Conner.
What now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
We're holding the workers down below.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I like my work.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
That's what the Kurgan said.
I know.
I love you, Conner.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Talley.
You should warn them, Sonny.
You think we should take that chance?
You won't die if you let me help.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
It's over.  We have to give up.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You got something to say?
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
I don't know.
Okey-doke.
What if it goes south?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
What do you want?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
What?
Special Agent Jones.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
He has lots of disks.
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I used to work at the Diplomat.
You want to pay me?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
What's happening?
I don't understand.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Whiskey?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
) You cannot kill them all.
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Lets go, Jock.
Great, I really need a shower.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Where are we going, sir?
You are the manager?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
What?
What cards?
I will need a suite.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
He wants your wisdom.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Do something.
No.
You could have asked for a favor.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
So where is the lamb?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
Why?
What's wrong?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Thank you, sir.
Out? Where are you going?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Don't think it'll be a problem.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
'Less the place really is haunted.
Uhhhh...
Pritchett, is that you?
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
I'm better than that.
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Good point.
Price!!
Don't think it's even an issue.
What --
You've got your own TV show?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
What are you talking about?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
-- and who's next on your list?
What?
Do something!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- confirming everything we already know --
Please! I need your help.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Wish I could take the credit, but --
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
-- I'm coming --
Damn it.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
I don't understand.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Can you talk to her?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
Why?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
You didn't think much about that before.
What?
So what are you saying?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
What?
I think we should do it.
Maura.
This isn't happening...
Keep talking!
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Not on station time.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Something bad.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Then tell me what to do.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
You gonna buy?
You're JP Monroe, right?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
I miss you too.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Eighth room down, babe...
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"You could be swinging on a star."
Why try?
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Let's just forget it, I mean...
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
And I'll bring my entourage...
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Catholic girls are scary...
Hudson, don't you understand...
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
I hope you know what....
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
We're here to say, your government was right.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why George, you big softie...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Shazzammeter!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Now, Amy --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
But, buddy --
Get up!
Well, why don't ya read it.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
No, sir.
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Thank you for waking me.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
I think you need some help.
You don't believe in it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Where do you think you're going?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
No, Wes.
Why was the maid crying?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
And charming?
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
She was beautiful.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You crying?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
What?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
See for yourself.
I'm not surprised.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
So how's school treating you?
All right.
Classes?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Ben--
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Birth control.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Good shit.
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You want coffee or something?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I suppose. Why?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Social work?
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
Huh?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Who said so?
I don't know.
Huh?
Is this Charles?
Right.
The ones you built?
He's dead.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Huh?
I love you.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
What about your shoulder?
He would have liked that.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
That's right.
Did she?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Thought I smelled something.
No game.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Down at the station?
But you wanted to.
There's nothing more to talk about.
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You said there were none.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I couldn't prevent it.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
What night? What do you mean?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
It can't be -
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
I don't pretend to know.
Unless I make her one of us...
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
What are you saying?
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
Yes.
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved your wife, surely.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Get lost, you scared me.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie...
What do you mean?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
Checking the locks again?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
I'm okay.
What do you mean, Julie?
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Oooh, the mainland --
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Hey --
What's going on?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
He is exhausted.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Well 
You're just talking nonsense.
They were gore before I came here.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Theodosia.
She's not too well.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
You are my friend.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
George . . .
Merry Christmas.
You what? To save me?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
By letting me help you.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
Yes, George?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
It will?
Goodbye, everybody!
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Well then, how do you know?
No.
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, forget it.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Say, where's Mother?
George.
Hello, Violet.
Nothing.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Have you notified the police?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Made up your mind yet?
Well, why don't you say it?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
When did you get back?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Is it snowing?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
What?
Oh, shit.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Why'd they decide to move?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
Hey!
Happy to do it.
Do I have to?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Oh, c'mon.
Michael.
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Me neither.
Wait a minute....
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The Shark's mouth.
Do you?
That's it.
Probably.
And sound.
Where's my day book?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
I'll give notice.
We have to do something.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Someone has to do something.
Martin, it could be anything.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
We're going to die.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Help!  Help!
Get a dance yet?
Nope.
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
No class.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
About damn time.
I thought you were grounded.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Be reasonable, please....
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
It hasn't adjusted.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Not enough loving.
No.
Hi, baby.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Up.
And leave me down here???
Michael...
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
... He ought to put him in here.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Afraid I can't do that.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
He's a young one.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
Depends on big brother.
Sure am.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Besides that.
No, think of something else.
Take it up!
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
That's impossible.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
You'll spoil her.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Can I make sandwiches...?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
It sure is good to be home....
Off....
What's wrong?  What happened?
You want to try your hand at something...?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Stop what?
That....
In a minute....
Can I ride one sometime...?
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
It was no accident....
It's just like driving a car....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
You sure you don't need glasses?
Want to go for a little ride?
I hope she's a good sailor....
Can't this thing go any faster?
The females have eggs....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
How long has he been here...?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
You getting a reading on them?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Cow tipping?
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
How about any guys on your staff?
Not too good in daylight ..
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
So am I. But where's my money?
Why's she blind, Bro?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
What about Citrine?
No, Sir.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Once.
And did they?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
I know what a "witness" is.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
The elevator wasn't working?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Yes.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I know about alcohol, John.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Yeah, I guess I do.
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
So tonight she confesses?
He's happy, darlin ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Ugh!
No one has ever dumped me.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Hey you.
Oh good.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Right.  I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You want...
What about medical?
He's coming over.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
First you gotta tell me something.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
What happened to Denver?
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Uh, not today, but --
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
You never had The Talk, did you?
You don't want to go home, do you?
No, you're --
Not everyone has what you have.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I think so.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
-- and I'll get 'em.
What's going on, Jerry?
ERRR-IIIC!
Her new boyfriend.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Udesky.
Well what?
That one time was just the bumper.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
He could have died.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
He loves you too.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Yeah.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Well that's good.
How do you mean?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
What are you talking about?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Are you looking for a problem?
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
How could you possibly?
How close do you have to be?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
What's he got in there?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Can you set up?
Are you insane?!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
What?
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
But would we get the phones back?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Pretty sure.
Oh my God.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Dr. Grant!
And scary.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Alan?
Faster, faster!
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
I can't see.
In a box under my seat.
Yes it is.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You have no idea.
You're sure?!
Hey, we were saving that!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
It's safe.
I'll stay awake.
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
_Krueger_...
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Oh?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
How long will he need to be asleep?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You're not going to be there?
What are you doing?
How's that possible?
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where's he going?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
How long will the effect last?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You wanted to see me, sir.
I usually take lunch by the River.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I know.
What?
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Why were you given notice?
Was he depressed?
What makes you think so?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
This is filed incorrectly!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I photographed it extensively, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I'm sorry ...
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
My name's John Klute.
Who?
-- Tuscarora --
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Well --
Not much point to this, is there?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Mm.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Where'd you spend last night?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Mm.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
Well as a matter of --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
That who?
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Are you closing the case?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer?
What do you have here, Billy?
What do you like best about her?
Show.
When is mommy coming back?
Will she pick me up after school?
I'm sorry.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Daddy?
I don't think so.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Is that really your chair?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Mom--I mean, dad?
Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Like a principal?
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Yes.  Very much.
Objection.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Yes.
I don't recall.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
I've seen him.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Joanna, I don't give a--
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Yes, what?
Kramer--
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
How many?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
No.  I don't think so.
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
We must go, Holiness.
Mama, my story.
Can I do anything I want?
Are you, General?
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Holiness?
How many?
Is that big?
And, America?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Me?
I have more men.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
You are unharmed?
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Too young?
Why are we landing?
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
We'd only just met.
Cocktail?
I coulda shot you, you--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Yup.
No!
Bastard bit my chopper.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
No.
He's gonna live?
Why are you here?  Really.
Who?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
<u>Are</u> you okay?
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Well.  Goodnight.
What?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Calm down.
Well...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
I'm fine, thank you.
What kind of backup do we have?
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
With what?
They don't believe her.
You think Jack's handsome?
Hank?
Hank!
Kelly.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm not even a field person.
It has nothing to do with--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Kelly--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Liar?
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
You're all right! Where is he?
I don't know! Get me out!!
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Miggs has been murdered.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I am, yes.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
It's much better than your shoes.
No, I came because we need -
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Reasonably so. Yes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
I never thought about it.
They all were.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Killed outright?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
So you ran away...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
My God, you've grown up.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
You still have an aversion to the water?
Will you consider that?
Yes. Go ahead.
Will you men help us stop the French?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Got a reason to stay.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
What a place for them...
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sergeant Major!
Yes.
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Qui vive?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
You mind if I take a look at this?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Was there such a thing?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Be careful with it.
DeJesus!  A readout!
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
We're getting out of here just in time.
No way...
No!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
You did good...
I need more light on that, Four.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What the?...
Bullshit.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How'd you do that?
It needs blood?
Are you sure you saw something?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Well, talk.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Apart from those shotguns.
I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Can I help?
They were going to pay, then?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
What are you doing?
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
I hope this is the right move.
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
I will.
It's pay day, ain't it?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
So?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
How many feet?
Leave your sister out of it.
I can fix cars.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
You're testing me?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
No. You?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Come on in--
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
So how come you got into all this?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Right.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
We should just do it.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
That's where he fell.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
You have somebody else out there?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
I haven't been out here for a while.
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
And the ten thousand?
Sam--
There was a mandate in the last election--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
That's me.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
That was the night he disappeared?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Mom?
Yeah?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Time marches on.
Well, you were working there--
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Couple months before I was born--
Yeah--
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Gotta be in person.
Yeah.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Uh-huh.
Hello, L.A.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
Death.
I'll tell you.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Why did you wait so long?
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
How did it go today?
He taught all this to Swann?
You said you weren't with him for love.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
... oh... God...
Don't look.
What about me?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
So could you walk on water?
I heard he was the best.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Shit.
Whose is the car?
You know of him?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Yes.
Yes.
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Sure.  Vivovich.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
How the fuck do you do that?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
They got here before us.
... no...
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Can you do it?
Why's that?
Yes! Yes!
Yes.
Yeah, they told me.
Bob, it's me.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Ok.
What about you? Why are you here?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, for her show?
And marriage, does that get easier?
No one ever tells you that...
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Charlotte?
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Bob?
I don't know.
What?
Yeah.
Ok.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I can't believe Will killed him.
What're these?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
It's nothing.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
May I help you?
What's that got to do with you?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Good seeing you again.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Monica, what did you do?
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Engaged.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Are you okay?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
I can take it.
You might be the only one with a job.
Mom tell you to do this?
No.
Yeah, right.
You lost your head.
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up?
Thanks.
What's up, Sidra.
Just like that?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Your Dad play?
Kay.
I know this.  What do you want?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Mulholland Drive.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Forget Tonya Randall.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Hey.
Hey, what's up.
We're going to get some food.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Few days ago.
So...I guess I'll see you around.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
You visiting?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
So...how's the knee?
Then why are you so upset?
One game.  One-on-one.
So you're gonna bitch up?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
Later when?
Sorry.  You okay?
Whose truth are you talking about?
What?
Your door was unlocked.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...yeah...
What?
Did you hear what I said?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Bit messy.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
-- is not my boyfriend.
If you're not here for a 422 --
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
No, no.
...yeah...
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
please, what is it, please --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Did you listen to me?
I was listening --
What happend?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
This sounds threatening.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
And how much is braces?
I've been a good worker --
Give me your keys, Don.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Yeah.
Do me a personal favor --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Who?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
Graduation?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Are you asking me that?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And that's what you've heard?
Around here.
She's retired.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
What? What? What now?
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
You're here.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
You on any medication?
--- What was that?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
No.  No.
Yeah.
How long with Ellen?
She's asleep.
You're her boyfriend?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
I can't.
Where will the money go?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
What are you doing?
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
818-753-0088.
What would you like?
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
C'mon, man.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Stand up.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
Alright.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
I have money.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
No, Louis!  No!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Who is he, Aramis?
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Now.  You were saying?
We must stop him!
Then to the Bastille.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
We go someplace dangerous.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Who?
Die?  What...?
D'Artagnan!
It's been too long.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
What is that?
Whose rooms are those?
I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Raoul... is in love...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Did you know... about Raoul?
Captain Doyle?
Yeah?
What the hell happened?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
What did the six-toes have to say?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
I'll take the south end -
Well don't you think that's odd?
Alright, where is she?
Are you alright?
Something I don't already know?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No, but I'm listening.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
I killed them.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm not going anywhere!
Are you going to be alright?
Where am I going?
That's when it happened?
Could he handle a direct contact?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Somebody hurt him?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
Last two like this we had, you caught.
As long as they're dead...
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Who is it?
I'll pick you up in...
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
'Changes?'
He's a very shy boy...
Something Lecktor said.
It's getting late and...
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Yes.
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Most people are.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
He only bit women so far, right?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
What's the problem, Molly?
Maybe we should give it some time...
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Meet point's up ahead!
Are you George Sherman?
Will it keep them out?
Yeah...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
No.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
And?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Yes.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Those are my terms.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
But wasn't it funny?
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi... am I late?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
So?  What do they know?
Goals are important.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
We had a deal!!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Where?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
You don't know.
Lieutenant?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Really?
Just get me outta here.
All right --
Right now?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
... am I dead?
More important than what is when?
That's why we're here.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
What happened?  What did you see?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
Can you fly that thing.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
How?
Operator.
What are your plans?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
What happened to you Flash?
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
I don't like loading crates.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
How?
Back so soon.
No.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
$20.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
What do they expect you to say?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Come on.
I know...I know.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Of course.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
What an odd pairing.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Shall we adjourn?
No.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Why?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Yes.
She knows you real self?
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Yes --?
Goodnight, Joe.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
No.
Gay?
I love your smell.
Susan --
No --
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Of course.
I'm not everybody.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Now I'd like to be alone.
Excellent.  What is it?
Truly - uh - splendid.
Why didn't you stop me?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
You were just curious?
You tell me, Bill.
I'm sorry, Bill --
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Yes?
You're what?
I don't expect you to.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
And we're very grateful.
Death!
Of course.
I don't!
I think you know --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
This one.
How did you know?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
What?!
I don't understand.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
What was that?
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
What's the way?
Why?
Not at all.
Why?
...We know so little about each other.
39.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
How long have I been here?
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
You think you can bargain with me?!
You know him?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Tell me about her again.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
How do I know he did that to you?
Did you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Kill him.
Where is he?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Neither do I.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Calm down.
Sweet.
A BEER, please.
Did Teddy send you?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Yup?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like what?
What's wrong?
You probably.							 *
No. You took them out.						  *
It is now.
Bullshit.							*
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
We know these people...!
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I don't know.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Make it 40%.
You do.
Okay.
What do you like to drink?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
No.
That's right.
What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Why?
Really?
Would you find me...?
Jos...
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Like...?
Chill out Sonny.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Go ahead.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Okay.  What's up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
So what do you want?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
How will it stand up?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
What flowers?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
And...?
What would you do...?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You ain't coming to work?
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
You don't seem like no fag...
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What of?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
What d'you want?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Uh, yessir.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Twenty months?
What?
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
Who?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Sure.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Would you recognize him again?
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
Feeling all right?
Hello, Billy.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Where is it?
We go back.
After we're outside the kogus?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Lady...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Can we get this car there?
We're no leaving you!
Please.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Great crowd.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Sure.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
I guess that means it's okay.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Well, I hope you like it.
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Misery's Return?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
I'm almost done.
Stop--stop right here.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
They're hauling Misery into court.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
What is it?
He's your client, huh?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Hey, Pete.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Newspapers?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Mmmm.
I suppose I did.
To win?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Ninety-three point four million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
What can we do' mate?
At least you walked.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Where do I meet you?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Yes, I believe that's right.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Roger that.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Take off your coat.
Where were you?
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
What happened?
Theyre dead.
No sir.
The arms dealer.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
What are we downloading?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Why don't you come back with me?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
IMF mainframe.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Why?
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Can you lose him?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
And get a doctor.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Try it again.
No, I'm going.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
I don't like him.
The guy died.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Maybe.
Why you looking around so much?
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
Yes.
Why?
This is good. Uhh...
Why what?
I don't know.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I'm telling you your life!
I can't believe what is happening.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
What are you talking about?
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Let me go home.
He's coming.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You don't want the fish.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
What do you mean?
On the floor?
What time is it?
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
WHAT?
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
No more he's not.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I know.
I came right from the airport.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's it! That's the reason!
You don't know where Loretta is?
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Sure!
Thanks, comrade.
I'm a housewife.
I think it's because they fear death.
People home.
I'm freezing
Rita. Rita.
Burn them.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What?
You're a liar.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Look!
Come Here.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Are you sure he's got one?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
You know my name?
What?
A G...g...g...
Man!
Yes, I see.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
What is your favorite colour?
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
When's your next round?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Leaving the room.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
The Castle Anthrax?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Camelot ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How about yourself?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye, but will they?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You should have someone look after you.
Checked and locked, sir.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
We --
You'll be sent a message.
Do you?
There are important papers from --
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What brings you here?
You're injured.
I wouldn't know.
Then I envy yo.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
She'll never understand it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
John?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Dead?
Has anyone seen Greg?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
It's already out.
You mean we learn the rules...
And beat it at it's own game.
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You don't get it, do you?
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Okay.  It's West.
Shit...
Our time's up.
And then keep on driving?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Cool.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I'm going home.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
But I'm not broke.
Cynthia...what's going on?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Sure.
One.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
My name is Rita.
No. I can't.
No ..........I.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I think I've been hurt.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Okay.
There's nothing?
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Yeah, what for?
This Denny's.
Hardly.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
No.  I haven't seen any.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
First Bank ? But how ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
You took an awful big risk back there.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Not listening !
I'm listening.
Why did you build this whole place ?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Just stop it. End it here.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Stop the hydraulics.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
What do you mean sir ?
Zachary.
Sir ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Then what do you want ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Thank you very much.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
Good morning.
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
You had to remind me?
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Don't mention it.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Sure am, who are you?
I'm glad you're here.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
I know that.
Hi.
Then what did she do?
Then I have come to the right place.
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
Thanks
But we made a business deal.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
You're over reacting!
I don't need you to be telling me to...
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
Get married?
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Give it to me!
What's that?
Wow!
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Yes, I do.
Well maybe for you.
You couldn't?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Hey! Oh look.
Let me hold him.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Of what??
WHAT?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Harry, I really think she.....
I had a good time tonight.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Dance with me?
I haven't danced in.....
Do you want to?
I ahh, better go.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Did you ahh, love him?
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Of course not.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
I love this guy! 
Yes..
Hi.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's okay isn't he?
What was my mama like?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Sure.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
We'd love to hear it.
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Did you read ALL these books?
No.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I like my name.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Daddy??!?!?!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I think it should be outlawed.
I will I promise.
Goodnight.
It's a mosquito bite.
It'll bleed.
No.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Run faster they're after us!!
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
No.
Like this?
Okay, okay.
For what?
You don't miss much.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
I have a suggestion...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I can see why.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
Try less appropriate.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
And loving him means loving all of this.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
No.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Please come, please.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
You got a real good memory, Star.
Is there food?
Barnett, please -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
She's going to rest now.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
You want anything?  A drink?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Not yet.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
Do you carry door handles?
Nash.
What year?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
When did you start singing?
Yes, it is --
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
And before?
No, I don't.
Linnea?
Hello.
I have to go.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What?
They said go see the chaplain.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Hundreds of times.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
For him?
We just got a gold record.
I'm Opal.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
You sure do it loud.
You think it will?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Yes you are.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Lobotomy Bay?
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
I admire them.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Rockin'!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
And where do you keep Mickey?
What the hell happened to you?
Are you all set?
But how can you say that?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Okay.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
That's two bucks, Joe.
You must be new in town.
That's right.
What d'you expect?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
How about another beer?
That's why you come back, huh?
Ain't your fault.
What d'you mean?
What's he like?
Okay, I guess.
How about it?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Don't call them that.
Is that so?
What about them?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
What about your boy?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Yeah!
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
No point fixin' it!
You heard me!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Just get her drunk.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like what?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Hi.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Take this off.
Can you get us into Straylight?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
What's this?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
What are you talking about?
Are you even really alive?
I don't have a girl.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Wait... You hear that?
What?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Why should I want to meet him.
How long have I been out?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Get up.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Forget it.
Anita!
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Bridgework?
What is this?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
How many times have I fired her?
Have you been there?
Gus?
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You having fun?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
See!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Is that true?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
Shock.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
If you went away, what would become of me?
No.
Uh-huh.
It's getting there.
Oh, please...
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
I think it's sad...
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
So, you feeling anything?
I feel like a jerk.
yeah, I had a bad night.
You want to talk about it?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
'Morning.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Research.
I gotta stay up, Max.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
What's that?
Can't be good news coming from you.
What?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Crossed over?
Oh God.
Call me Nancy.
Sounds like a rough time.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Try me.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
And what are they?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
I could've saved them.
What did you think?
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Why is he after us?
No!
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Hi.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
I thought you were leaving.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
Why?
She saw through me.
You've got to go.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
You have a stunt bottom?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
What does it say?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He wouldn't say.
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
No!
Is this your first film?
Me?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Still, not sparkling.
What's your name?
Mr. Thacker?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Any more announcements?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Cool, huh?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Maybe.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Why not?
Was it you?
What's going on?
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
Bad news.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Mister Harding?
M-m-m-ma'am?
I was in luh-love with her.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Thank you, ma'am.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
So long suckers.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
What?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Okay, sucker.
What's your plan, Mack?
Why not?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Bet a nickel!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
How are you feeling?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
Yeah, what's up?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
You know, I never got your name.
Yeah...
P.A. What the hell is that?
There they are!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
He's dead.
You ol' fucker!
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Let's find a telephone.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
I'm a liberal!
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Hm.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
You're limping.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Why?
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Right now?
Do you want me to do it?
Hey--
What?
Hi.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
You're Damon Bradley?
Tonight?
Excuse me?
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
But it's July.
Because you were afraid to fly.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
What'd you find?
A phone message.  Only--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
And then what, Faith?
Who said I was going?
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Giovanni.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Right.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
What?  You know him?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Sure we keep records!
Well, where are they?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
That's right... .
Mmhmm.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
Father Barry.
The moment I saw you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
What?
I don't know.
It's quite  nice.
Were you really a prize fighter?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
What are you crying for?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
It's true.
Edie!
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
What I did to Joey.
I know what you want me to do!
My pigeons... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Every one of 'em... .
Am I on my feet...?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He wanted to see me again.
I don't get it!
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Good luck.
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
What?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Looking for me?
You ought to go home and take care of that
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
So-so, Johnny.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
You ratted on us, Terry.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Listen Nolan
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
She was?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
It would seem so, Master
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Oh, if there is only time!
Your pleasures of course!
Is there time?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
He wants us.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
I'm a tourist.
Let's go to Detroit.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
How long you talk to her?
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
And she saw you?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
What?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You'll have to ask him.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
You excited?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Why, are you famous?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
You don't seem all that scared.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
How'd you get this number?
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
You won't do that.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
You believe that?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You were going to see her?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
How many?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Of course not.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
Hejira.
She did, huh.
You're not?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
You're a fighter?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
I'm looking for Maurice.
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
What'd I say?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Midge.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Nah, you go on.
I didn't mean it.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Yeah.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Well sure, Colonel --
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Oh, this is Betty.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
The only one?
Where is it?
I'll call you Later.
It's that jerk Walter.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Looking good out there.
He's trying.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
I've got to go now.
Charlie? Was I dead?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Don't get your hopes up.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
For me?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Mom!
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Would you get that, dear?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Don't eat the red ones.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
What's up?
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
What's his name?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You want me to help?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
This time. What about next time?
Why are you getting dressed?
Maybe you should think about it.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
One week old.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Opera?
What kind of person is that?
Except... you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
What?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Hello?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
How many gays do you know?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Duh...
Going on... like...?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
One or two.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
But they...they could still be....
You barely know them.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
What the hell's it matter?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
This does not help us, Johns.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
We crossed our own tracks.
What the hell are these?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
It's probably wrong --
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Which direction?
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
If only we could get a fix.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Climb off me, will you!
But I'm not prepared to die.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Thats a lie!
Sustained.
No.
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Which one?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
So what's the problem?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Fuck this shit!
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
First time?
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Must be somebody?
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
You know what I'm talking about!
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Bank?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
You don't know who he is?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Do you think I was faking?
Beer?  Well, all right.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You were there when I last saw him.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
Very ridiculous.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Sometimes.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You'd be breaking the law.
It could have been an accident.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
How would you know, Brandon?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Passkey?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
I've met her.
I'll know when I find it.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
May you what?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I don't understand.
I'm interested in who handled it.
No doubt about that one.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
Who's the girl?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Hello.
Yes, please.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, but he was terrific.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
To the Fleet.
It's shit.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
That's enough of that.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Fuck off.
Okay, I will.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
So how is she?
That's good.
We'll see what we can do.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Friends of yours, huh?
How you figure?
Once.
You gotta earn trust.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Three seconds... two... one...
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
The hell are they?!
They took a left at the next light!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Who's the girl?
Meaning you were expendable.
What?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Well, I saw you and--
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Like the old days, Dillon.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
We can reach an understanding on this.
Congratulations, sir.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit... and spin.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
For an hour.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
I'm not just talking about sex.
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Vivian...
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Business.
I got tired of hating my father.
Vivian...
My what?
Cynthia's not coming?
What!?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit...
Go for the bucks.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I'm just going to my room.
Niece?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Me?
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Would you like to try it on?
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
With pride. What can I do for you?
But how can you be sure?
Well ... you were dead.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
-- well, when does it get good?
Oh no. No, please.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Where's Fezzik?
-- offer me everything I ask for --
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I smell nothing.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Bye-bye, boys.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
What?
"Honeymoon,
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Help!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Maybe you're happy.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
It won't run a week!
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Liebkind, no!
Don't help me.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
You, Blum go Motel.
Feeling better?
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Vat?
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What do you do best?
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
You out to buy a motel?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
Back where?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
She stole some money.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Yes.
I was getting to that!
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Well?
Where'd you go to college?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
What?
For what?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
No.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Don't miss your plane.
No.
I've caused you some trouble.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
Uncommon, too.
I imagine so.
Only my share.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Alright, Miss... 
No, m'am.
Please... I'd like to go...
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Do what?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Maybe you're right.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
But where do the rats come in?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Did you hear?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Are you giving me this straight?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
That's what I said.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
How's every little thing?
What does that prove?
What do you mean police dog?
Fine, thanks.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
That happens to be the truth.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Is that a fact?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What are you laughing at?
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Excuse me???
We flopped the first time out.
Dysfunctional --
In what sense were they bad?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
What did you expect?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
You better quit that.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I do, too!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
But how would you find him?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
She's getting herself up to go out.
Yeah.
They're discussing it.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What's goin' on?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I am not being brutal to her!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
It's twenty after one.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
You don't know where you're going?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Yes, sir.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
You mean a farm?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Um-m, well...
Yes, dear, what is it?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Never again, never again...
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Where you gonna be?
What?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
What about him?
Happy Independence Day.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Follow me.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
We got him.
Slow down.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You always did have style.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Wouldn't miss it.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Hey, are you awake?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
We're coming!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I'm going in.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
He's my father.
But, why must you confront him?
Yoda, I must know.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I was telling the truth.
Janet!
The future is ours so let's plan it.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Well I want to leave.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Right!
You know this earth - this person.
Good God.
A decision had to be made.
"Transylvania"
On the day I went away.
Wheeling
Are you - giving a party?
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Why?
I think he might be worried.
Do me another favor?
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
...Like you?
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
Don't do that again!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Did ya get the license number?
Of wa?
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
A hundred an' thirty.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Black market?
Makes your breath like garbage.
What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Come July, twenty-five.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
How do you mean?
Freak luck for sure.
Whatta' those?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatta you get outta this?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Shoulda guessed.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Does it hurt?
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
So altruistic.
Where is he?
Hold on a second.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Then I'll leave thee.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Hold Daughter!
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
I have.
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
What?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Ay me!
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
Pink for flower.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
We kept it...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
From Interpol?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
Who are you?  IRA?
Shut up!
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Where's my information?
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
I swear...
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
But first you have something to take care of?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
It's been known to happen.
What a surprise...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Where is this broad?
Where to?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Not exactly.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
Do what?
You would have done that?
You think?
Not here.  They might see it.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Closest and oldest.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
Sort of!
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Dwayne listen to me -
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
You killed him...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
That's right.
He killed her...he killed her...
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Just take it in stride.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Nothing's wrong.
Are you sure you're OK?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
You're worth every last penny.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
What?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Anything I can help you with?
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Sure.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Whatever...
I'm not asking.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Not in the trunk.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, sir.
Two-hundred thousand!
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
This is your ship?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh, you American?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
What's wrong?
It's my job!
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
No, no, that would be crazy --
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Slow down, baby.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What is it?
I don't understand?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
She saved our lives.
Fine.
Yes.  We have heaven.
Dancing?
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Ricky Tan is alive.
What?!?!
Yes.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Why don't you go get them?
How do I know I can trust you?
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
You want more?
I'm sorry, Lee.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
They put you in charge?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Nobody touches me.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Yes.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Hello.
Han?
I will not have friends in America.
I'm not running.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
And in a "V".
It's hurting.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
You're coming here?
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Give me that!
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Maybe someday.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Of what?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Lost!
Well, you do have the dress.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Good boy, Port Hole.
What?
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
That doesn't make any sense.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
You go.
About forever.
What was what?
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Turn on your radio!
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
What?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
What about the letter?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Go home for the weekend.
Please --
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
Magic.
It's you.
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Why not?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Is he home right now?
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Hey, my plate is full.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Window.
P.  Dad?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
What do you think?
What was?
I don't know.
Listen to this --
Okay.
God, she's beautiful.
You said we could go to New York.
What about it?
How's Jonah taking it?
He's good at it.
You're welcome to one.
No thanks.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Antonio paid for it.
What's the matter?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Tell me.
Sun up.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Where's your mama?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
That's it?
Who wouldn't?
Yeah.
Oh God.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
You don't understand.
: What are you up to?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
What's wrong, Danny?
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
Why?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Why's that?
Fuuuuuck
By not disgracing her memory!
No, I'm good.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
You want to do this some other time?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You think I'm a Judas?
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Really?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
What do you mean?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Where's Bubba?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
What is that? Rum and coke?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
In West Fork?
Yep.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
What do you think?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
I wasn't made for this.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Uh, oh.
I don't think so, Captain.
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
What if our guys open up, sir?
Maybe Caen.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Frogs?
Lingerie.
Pardon me?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
How can you, how can you say that?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
No, no, don't go in there.
I'm gonna call her.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd, it's us.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Ha!
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
What?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
Okay, I give up.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Morning.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
You think you know what this money is?
You will?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
I'll go.
What are these?
Keymaster?
So it's an honor?
You know what?
Yeah.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Are you comfortable?
No.
I don't think so.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
How's it going?
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
How you doin', brother?
Oskar, please -
What -
I'm sorry to hear that.
We started without you.
What's going on?
You took my workers.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
Where are the guards?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
Yeah, okay.
Pistols?
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
Christmas presents.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
Are you losing money?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Four hundred, four fifty -
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
We know that, son.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why would you wanna do that?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Its over, Cotton.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
And much richer as a result.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
Where's Sid?
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Why?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Miss Weathers.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
You have every right to be upset.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Meaning?
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Don't worry...
Just in case...
What do you mean?
No, wait...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Yes, goddammit!
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
Can I come with her?
Her old boyfriend?
..this week's TKE kegger...
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
I hate scary movies.
Shush.
You ass.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I get scared really easy, okay.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Who is this?
I don't know.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
What did you know about your mother?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Stop following me.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Who's this?
I'm hanging up right now.
No.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I didn't kill anybody.
Nope.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yes.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
No.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Gotta go.
No...
NOOO!
...please...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Has his story changed?
LEAVEMEALONE!
I heard screaming.
Have a good trip.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
And what would be your motive?
There goes my chance with Sid.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
No way.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
He was there, Tatum.
Take a message.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
For once, Stu, drop it.
That's mature.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
So what?  This victim...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
Murderers like you?
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Who said this was murder?
No.
Is that clear?
Same color and texture.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
What?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
You got to be kidding.
How is this legal?
How do you know all about this?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
Slut.
Tell me it's not true.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I don't see anything.
What?
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
I say NO!
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
And maybe you lie...
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Hey! What's the idea...?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Not no more.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
We got two around that age...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Who's that?
What?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
How did you get me out of there?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Mrs. Straub!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
And the title of this piece?
Oh
Yes.
Are you writing?
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
She is always Aphrodite.
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
By God, I wish I knew.
Kit
Burbage says you have a play.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
"Of love?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
And I love poetry above all.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh but why "alas?"
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh my lady, my love!
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
And that was only my first try.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Oh, Will!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Then I will go with you.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
I . . .
Yes, sir.
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
Your aunt?
She sings too?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
You are on my ground.
Serve.
What?
Will you shut up and play.
I'm only asking what you think.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Can we talk about something?
You're not eating.
I want to secure it.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
About the mail --
This is just an informal discussion.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
Did you know --
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Hugo.
What are you doing?
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
You know we're right.
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Interesting.
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
Who said there were four?
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Two hundred pounds.
What?
No one.
But they sneer, don't they?
What guy?
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
I see.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
The first one was fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
You're looking great, baby.
-- Anyway.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Oh, no.
That headboard.
No.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
I asked you first.
Don't make conversation with me.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
No.
Then what do you think?
You do know what money's like these days.
George!
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
It's hot in here.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What?
Did you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- what guy?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- what?
That sounds like me.
-- yeah.
-- we are?
I don't know... Jackie?
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
That's too bad.
Call me!
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Yeah.
Yeah, baby.
What!
No, but I think they might.
I'll call you.
Look at the way I live.
Now, Jackie --
-- go ahead.
Didn't you, baby?
Yes.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
George...
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
What did you say?
Well, yeah.
Thank you.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
... this doing hair it's...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Isn't that bad for it?
Well... who are those guys?
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Who?
No --
Wasn't sure it was you.
No.
Come on by.
I'll call you back...

I'll call you back.
I am?
Of course not.
Here.
Jackie Shawn.
-- you phony asshole --
That's right.
See you later.
I would say so, yes.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Oh. thank you.
-- no.
I don't think so.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
-- what's the problem, honey?
Do you have children?
Everything okay, son?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Okay...oh!
Danny?
Mommy... Mommy...!
Talking to Tony.
Oh,
To my stomach.
Shall we go into the living room?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Advocaat is it?
Grady?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Bill, how do you do?
What line of work are you in now?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
I don't know.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Give me the bat.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
Well, obviously some people can be
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Royalty?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Please, Uncle Al.
Rats...
Yeah.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Huh?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know what we're saying!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Chops?
I knew that.
Babies
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Experience!  Right?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Your name?
The reason?
What's a concubine?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
A what?
Is this all the food I get?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
You're my Olympic event.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
He's a businessman.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Like what?
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
I am?
I think they'd understand.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Where's who?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Peace on Earth.
Where?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Bring Young Masbath here.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
They need guidance.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Chosen me?
Not for lack of trying.
Out there.  What do you see?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What books?
Why... why are you like this?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
You promised justice.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What was that?
Quickly, close it.
Where?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
She has confessed.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Can I see him?
Can I help you?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
French-fried potaters.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
They was a boy. We made friends.
It's too big.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
No sir.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
What's you last name?
Childers.
They let you out?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Two people.
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Naw.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
You will? For sure?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Did Vaughan go home?
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
You scared me.
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
And what about for you?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
A photographer ...
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Uh, better make it one.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Ready. Any time you are.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
What do you mean?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
She looks just like you.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
For keeps?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
What is this, some kind of joke?
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And how much are these?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Just passing through.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Huh?
So what's the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Well, if you put it that way...
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Mostly what.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Here and there. Around.
Drawing's a good thing.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Come on, just a little hint.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Yes, please.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Is that your third question?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
I can just feel my spirits soar.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And the next one...?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
That's when he fell.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
What makes you think I play?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
The same.
For certain, no.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Upsy-daisy.
Okay. 
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
I thought you weren't talking to me.
You've flipped your wig!
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
They got the bull-fiddle.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
We'll take a rain check.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
And that's one of them.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Here you are, Sugar.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
I'm a what?
Josephine -
Well, I'll come back later.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
No!
Thirty-four.
How did those holes get there?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
This is where I get off.
You're leading again.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Why?
And you'll be in all evening?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
It's not the backs that worry me.
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
Then why did you take this job?
You can't trust those guys.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
What's in Florida?
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
My fault.
Why?
Which one is yours - the big one?
Well, I'm not.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- riding to hounds -
Oh?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What is it?
It's the crews' night off.
They just sort of leave me cold.
See?  Nothing.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Thank you.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Me?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
I don't know what you're talking about.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
If Ed ever found out....
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Mom, please.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
I thought you said you were crap.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Nothing, nothing.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
That was a long time ago.
No, count it, anyway.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
You stand on your tiptoes.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
You shit!
Yes.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
You have had girlfriends?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
I should go.
Dad!
I always wondered what happened with us.
What is it you do again?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You could? How?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
They gone to the field...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sunday...
David!
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Come, I'll take you home.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Where you goin'!?
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I wanta see Nathan.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
You're late, Cartman!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Mkay.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
I don't know.
Hello there, children!!
Who are you, kid?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
What's that?
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Oh, brother.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Huh?
And Bill?
I am the dark master!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
The F word?!
How is the children's progress?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
Fight the power!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
Got it.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Well I appreciate that.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Where the hell did you come from?
All too well, captain.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
I think I can handle it.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
You better start making sense!
Barnes?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
He certainly is polite.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
The pin machine?
Nope.
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Think he bought it?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Cool!
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
What ever happened to just bowling?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
After we eat, Dad.
Leave him alone!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Line up where you want it.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Uh...over easy.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Mind if I cut in?
No, I'm fascinated.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
You're here.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
You should.
Why did you come back?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm not here to bowl.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
How big is this spacecraft?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
But she's --
What do we use for defense?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Captain.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
I see it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
You don't know that.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
She wired this system.
Radiation shield, you think?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
What sub?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Beth --
You bastard.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
But I don't know how --
We must've had it delivered then.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
But how?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
But why is he doing it?
It's for motion sickness.
Sintag.
Parasolutrine?
I'll just boost the doses.
How fast does it take effect?
I'm sorry.
For what?
The sphere looks different.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
How do you feel about snakes?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Shut up, Beth --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth --
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
We can refuse to talk.
C'mon.
I don't follow you.
What is that?  That noise?
What are you still doing here?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit's gone.
The three of us.
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
How's that working out, by the way?
What'd you say to him?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Good idea, Ted.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Beth and Harry?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
You mean a picture?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
What kind of a crash was it?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Is that good or bad?
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
What do you mean?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Well, I practice a lot...
Get to the ship!
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Are you the boy for me ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Well, yeah, sure...
Hi, mom.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Not a problem.
How bad are you, pal ?
Don't be a hero...
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Our data is being prepared.
What does that mean?
Programming ready?
<U>Computer off</U>!
Captain, what's the next move?
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Time to impact...?
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
To you, sir?
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I understand...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
...who...?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
No, I don't...
What happened?
Uh huh.
What?
...lost the screw...
...yes.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Yes...
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Where have you been...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
What courthouse?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Fourteen year old girls.
How big is this horse?
This horse is booked.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
You can go...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<u>Bobby</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I'm very sorry to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
What?
...yes...
Yes.
And you know what...?
I...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Kiss my ass.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Town's out of lilacs.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I can't.
I hurt my finger.
I'm out.
<u>Siddown</u>!
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
It's lovely.
That's what I said.
Marty...
I don't got the money.
If you do the product placement...
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Do something.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
...not at all...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Well, not exactly s...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I said...
What's Thursd...
Great.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
And what do you do wh...
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
I'll miss you so much.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
She still packing for her trip?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That doesn't bother me.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Uh.  What is it?
No.
But you told us to starve.
IS THAT YOU?
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Rache says it's from you.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Which part of no don't you understand?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Are you here?
Napalm.
I'm worried.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
To make it easier for them or you?
WE are over.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
It's temporary.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I need practice.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Anxiety.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
You WHAT?
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
So I'll have to order in?
I trust you of course I do but --
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Out! Leave the table!
You heard me: leave the table!
Oh.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
No.
Speak English.
You have a bay?
How did they execute him?
Don't even joke about that!
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
Ready for tomorrow?
OK.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
...gger.
Fuck me hard!
Again!!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
That's good.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Thanks.
Scooby?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Is he with the girl?
What are we going to do!
Cooper...
What happened?
It's nothing to worry about.
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
What do you mean?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Just what the hell is he talking about?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Yes?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
What are you talking about, Major?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
This is General Ripper speaking.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
That is correct, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Right.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Check target approach.
Second safety.
He's dead.
What do you mean?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Mn-hm.
I don't anymore.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Okay, okay.
Fuck it!
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
What she doin' in the van, man?
Guess not.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Really?
Oh, you were in the band?
Am I fucking him?
Buff.
Score! Yeah!
It's safe, come on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Come on. Inside.
You rich?
Yes.
I'd like to.
Mm.
Taking care of business.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Two-fifty.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Well, w-what happened?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Yes.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
This is my home.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Seven-twenty.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
You could've come over.
Oh! Trim it!
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
So you can give me more shit?
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Yes, I stand for -
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
'Bye, Jeff.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
The prom. That's funny.
Sorry.
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
So who are you?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Hey!
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
I'm moving.
If...
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that Jeff?
Yeah?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
About what?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
If you hit me...
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Sorry, Kansas...
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Diane?  Diane!
You sure?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Madonna.
Hello?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
What the hell do you want?
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
As for instance?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I'll make it short.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's Norma?
Why not?
What happened?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Hers.
What assistant?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Just a minute, you!
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
December twenty-first.
There sure is.
What's that?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.

I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
He must be quite a guy.
Good.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
You are not dressed properly.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
I'm not here.
The doctor suggested it.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Got a title?
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Haven't got a thing.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Western Europe.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Tell me where I can find her.
We're from different worlds.
You're not afraid are you?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Oh no, not you again.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Nurse! Nurse!
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Where is inner space?
What is this place?
That horrible woman!
You're going to take me back?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
The kid needs a man to show him --
You look wonderful.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Who?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
What about this week's check?
Or socks.
Wipe 'em out?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Fair's fair.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
What will it get me?
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Lots of things...
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
I don't know you, lady.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Lois, what are you doing?
Actually, yes.
Who ????
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Lois, I really don't see why --
You'll have to pack quickly.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
I like trees.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
Artemis? Do you read me?
DELETE IN CUTTING
Where?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
What shall we do now?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Yes?
He's captured Non!
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
What I need this for?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
But . . . how could you beat him?
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
Not...gray.
Unbelievable.
Stop him, Clark!
What now, my love?
Huh?
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
You're just jealous.
Shut up.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
I read the article.
Meteorites!
You're not going to hit me?
You got wax in your ears?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
I guess I got carried away
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Who...who...
Right on the first guess.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
You think they're strange?
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Sort of.
What is this??!
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Ally Jones.
Case?
I'll be back around nine.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I'm not sure.
She's resting.  In her room.
It's natural.
Sure.
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
You talked about it?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
I did.
That's what he said, is it?
No.  A little sugar though.
And winter?
Yes.  It's a present.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Yes.
Oh.
Dolores.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
She...she was a friend of mine.
Is this it?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Some more wine?
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
You remember this?
That was great.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
How do you like it, Nicole?
How will he do that?
What do you mean?
But Charlene...
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
He's somewhere...
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Can I come out?  No.
I know Manny Davis.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Can't hurt...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Talk to her, Sidney...
What about?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
In his apartment -
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Yeah!
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
That's the third time he's called today.
But what?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
You ought to be used to me by now.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Why me...?
We stick in each others craw.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Do you have bandages?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Smile?
She intends to change the future somehow.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Is it dead?
It must end here... or I am the future.
No shit?
Out of the way, John!
They took him from me.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I must be destroyed.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Some.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Yes.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
You live here, in Berlin?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
May I ask a question?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Yes, I know who he is.
And what did he say?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Of course I know what that is.
Helmuth.
Yes, you remember.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Right. Claims assessor.
Great.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
I don't understand...
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
You cold?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want it to be over for you.
Good fighters.
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
The stock will turn.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
I could fight you on this.
Did you play recently?
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
This can't be real...
This is nuts.
If there was one.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Where are we going?
A fresh shirt...
Is this you?
What's wrong?
What did you say?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
What do you think you're doing?
Where'd you get that... ?
We searched the house.
Stop talking to them!
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
Yes.
They'll be wanting it back.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Are you still on mediction?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How did those... ?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
It's different every time.
How long will these take?
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Fine.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
I don't like her.
Nicholas...
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Yes.
I don't know.
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Come on.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
What's his first name?
David.
That's so sad.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Italian?
Who?
We think?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
You think I'm staying?
Huh?
Been to the Boat Show.
I didn't expect anyone.
Did Jenny know?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
What's so fucking funny?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Oh, it just ended, then.
She never told Eddie, though.
How'd you manage that, then.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
My employer.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
You don't seem bothered.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I guess you're just habitual.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Where is he now?
Yeah.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
What are you doing here?
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Geez, Mr Crane.
...No, please.
...You are ze fahzer?
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Mm.
Uh--
You got the dough?!
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
And how do we share--
It's OK.
...That's quite a wife you got there.
She's a rare one.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...You know... who *who* is?
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
Honey...
...OK.
Yeah.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Sure you don't need one?
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
...You sure, Eddie?
...You ever wonder about it?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Not an owner.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Homicide.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I don't want to scare people.
Behind you.
Forget it!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
The body?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
What is it?
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What's going on?
I'm coming with you.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
What do you do?
What is it?
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
A monster?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Is there another way around?
I think... it means it's full.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
That's right.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Cue music...
Thank you.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
No.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I've been thinking--
What're you doing down here?
Arrah!
So why do you want to go?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
--Darling--
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
--How do you know about that?
I don't understand.
Yup.
What do you do?
Does what?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
How can this be?
Yes.
I'm looking for him.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
How'd you find me?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You told me you had answers.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Mulder -- it's me --
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Where are you, Mulder?
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
I was until about an hour ago.
Why are you whispering?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
This looks like new grass to you?
-- of what exactly?!
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
This virus -- it... 
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Scully --
Cold...
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?
Where is he?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
I do it all the time!
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Then what is he?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
COME ON!
Yep.  Eloped.
You liked him?
Who says?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
What about the legalities of this...?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
What about narcotics?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Is she alright?
Dr. Kent.
Awaiting his arrival.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
What else do we do?!
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
H-E-Z-T...
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Are you going, too?
I shall be all right.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
His.
Oh, well.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
He works in a military hospital.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Martins.
See much of him before that?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
It wouldn't work.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
What is it, Sergeant?
Hmm.
Unwise, Holly...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Oh, you did.
That's all you meant?
...this time.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Richard - I saw a fin!
She is gone!
He tried to borrow money from us.
One kilometer
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They don't have extermination camps.
What, do you like it here?
What do you care?
Too difficult?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Are they still together?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Bigger and better.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
You shouldn't.
No, I think you shouldn't.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
A poison...?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Female...
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
But I wasn't.
Daniel Balint.
Hello...?
That's meat.
Steve...
What are you doing here?
They're not my people....
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Which was his room?
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
JTS...?
Who'd you kill?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Dennis Leary.
Fund-raising??
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
You're going to live here permanently?
Does he know?
Johana, am I boring you?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
What d'you mean?
No!
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You know each other?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
You forgot the Hula!
What was he like, when he was little?
Well, good night, then...
Jacques!  Johana!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
I won't, I swear.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Enzo, wake up!
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Well, what are they?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
No, no!
Enzo?
No.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Here...  Here...
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
And you?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Johana... New York.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
What!?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
I don't know.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
About Charlie's leopard?
Why did you give up teaching?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Are you all right?
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Are you all right?
Mr Lombard...
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Youre mad...
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
You dont say.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
May I have your phone number?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
I see. How much?
Who are you?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Your secretary, huh!
Okay. Recommended...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
What happens now?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Maybe I dont.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
Trying to say something, Martin?
At what time will you be available?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Five to three. Youre early.
Im sorry...
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Hows the boy doing?
I... How long have I been here?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Welcome to the club.
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Costliest!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Tell me...
No, but...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I -- I don't understand...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Good.
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Do you have a sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Scared of a girl?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Please... may I have it back...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Does he have hair?
Go on to the next question.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
In His name??
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I need to confess again.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
He never says his name.
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
Sit.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
I need help.
I'll be fine.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
I've no money.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
I know.
What are you reading?
Yes, but what good did it do?
Why didn't you come to me?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Pig!
No sound at all?
Baines is packing up?
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She wants it to come.
What on?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
I'm out, Johnny.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
There's always a depression on.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
What do ya want the others to get?
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 500.
See and raise 1,000.
The name is Lonnegan.
Who are you?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
What the hell for?
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
How am I gonna do that?
No.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
What's your next step, Nick?
That is, if it's all right with you.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
What are you talking about?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Why... in the heart.
How's your brother?
And he still wants to marry me!
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Rosebreen.
Shut up.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I know.
All right.  All right.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
We're just having a little drink.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I trust you.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
Can't you get to sleep?
Someone get a doctor.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Did I give it to you?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
Not with all your money!
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Back to California
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What things made you so sure?
You worked here?
Trying to put it off on her?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
I know I left them there.
I'm sorry...  but...
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Maybe I do.
You got no reason to do that!
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Just keep quiet.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Invest it.
Wh-what do you think--
They'll shoot us!
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just relax.
My leg is falling asleep.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
We're not going to do anything.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Jesus, Jaeger.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
No.
You still got a map on you?
What do you think our chances are?
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
What did you say?
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
What do we do?
Shi'ites, I think.
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Yeah.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
What?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
You get it yet?
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
You ever think about dying?
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Oh, Jesus!
You have to go with us, Wes.
So?
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
You know I don't feel well.
It's 3+27 hundred
No!  Don't go.
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'll report you.  It's....
I'm leaving.
I was lost.
How do you know?
What kind of answer is that?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What do you want?
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
May I help you?
Where did you get this?
Now wait just a fucking-
Only once, at Redstone.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
What's up?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Who is he?
Thank you.
What is that?
What's the matter?
What about the ballistics report?
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Make an appointment.
A what?
I'll do it.
Sir...
What's this?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Constantinople?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Um-hum!
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
You say I am a crook.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Yes...?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Good night.
Talk? About me--about us?
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
Like that?
But attractive--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
Instantly.
Yes, Gaston?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
Goodbye.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Two lumps, madame?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
He started it.
That's right.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
A hundred and one next month.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
The partners want to know how it's going?
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Why have we stopped?
You're distracting me. Go away.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I don't know the steps.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
I know, I know.
It's getting quiet.
Is your stateroom alright?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Feeling a little better, I see.
No-o!
Guess again, copper.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
How about giving me another coat?
Brett is the name.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
But--
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I thought you were a smart guy.
You don't think--?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
My change.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Coming to the pool for a swim?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Where do you live?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Who won?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Yes.
What's the matter, Mary?
--And he has sex appeal.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Eh?... Oh.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Yes, Yes!
Why?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Oh, my God...
A peace officer... Impressive man
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
What?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Colorado's closer
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Praise Jesus!
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Wyatt!  My God...
Well hello, Sherm.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Get down, boy.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
So why did you leave?
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
What - no lust for adventure?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
- Four wheel drive?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Fishing?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Hey - the world is my office.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
- You're not.
Why don't we just take these -
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... And what do you call these?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
What's your name?
I was an attorney!
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
You won't get away with this!
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
What's wrong?
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Is the helicopter ready?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Like a veil has been lifted?
What for?
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Now who are we talking about?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
None of your business.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Where is Skip?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Here!  In the car!
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
We're almost there.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
That's why.  Sid.
I could have stopped him.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Hold on, Woody!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Something's screwy here.
I don't know!
Hey!!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
What the heck is up there?
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
W-w-w-we?
Woody!  Speed up!
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Did you meet the President?
I don't know.
Helena --
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
How are your grades?
What's that mean?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Chill out --
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
Yes.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You're breaking my heart.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
You first.
You will help me with my other problem.
Yeah.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
A group of us are going out tonight.
An informant.
What is it you want me to do?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
Noriega is a criminal.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I got money.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
I'll be right after you.
You've stabbed me, man.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Thanks.
What's your name?
What?
Holding hands?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Yes.
It's an interesting theory.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Screenwriter?
Who wrote it?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
He made me lick it.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What was your price?
We're two thousand short.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Such as?
How's it going with Gail?
That's fair enough.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Following new course. Warp seven.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
What is it you seek?
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
And that is?
Oh, God
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Hmmm?
I trust your message was received?
No conditions.

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Spock?
You invented Space Paranoids?
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Did he say why?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
For what?
Beautiful!
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Oh. Anything else?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm your program?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Cute.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Wrote the...?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
I'm shocked.
You bitch.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Yeah, right.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
What's the plan?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
What are you talking about?
She's lying.
Hello, Harry.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
What'd you do, honey?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
Why did you continue to see him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
God, you have great legs.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Helen.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You got that playing basketball?
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
The oriental.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
Would you like to get some pie?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
What do you do?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
How long have you worked here?
What's that?
You know when you sat behind me?
What would make you think that?
You mean she got a bad batch?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Who and what is a Drexl?
What?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Naw naw!
Can you live with it?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Do you really mean it?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
How 'bout me what?
What are we gonna see?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
He wants to talk ya.
Don't you?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
She seems very nice.
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Do tell. Why drug related?
I've seen him.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
What about him?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Could we try it now?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
He saw the wire.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
We're very close!  Because of you!
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
Mason???
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
What made you think that?
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
I need to make a telephone call.
Germs?!
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
But you know what's real now?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
What do you want for free?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
I need a ticket.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Let me get your change.
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, what is that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Jesus.
Wasn't nothing.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Where you headed?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I can't.
From?
Lied?  What do you mean?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace . . . Grace?
If you want.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
Now what?
Where the hell am I going to go?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Who the hell are you?
Accident.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Not from where I stand.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
How old are you?
They're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Christ, I don't believe this.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
I didn't do anything.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You broke my nose!
An overheated car.
California...
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
What makes you say that?
You love her, but you hate her?
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
Two-hundred dollars?
Got any requests?
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
No charge.
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Look, Harlin.
No.
I'm just going to my car?
Where you coming from?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I have an idea.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
You could leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
You'd never understand.
You mean the Shaman?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Can you make it back up?
Why's that?
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
I axed you a question.
Is Noel in?
Oh.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
What did I say?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Okay.
Megan?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Rust?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
Think carefully?
It's for last week's game.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
I thought he was carrying something.
Like what?
He's kind of a miracle.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
I see.
That's great.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
Twelve years.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Well, go get it then.
I fined 'em instead.
You told them cowboys you had it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
He tell you where them others is?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Scouting?
Oh. Yeah.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
She back in Kansas?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
No?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
All week?
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
But he was called...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Ned's share?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A sign on him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Then... what?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
It's gonna get riper yet.
You could have it. All of it.
You ain't shot.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Shit.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Three.
Tom?
Fuck you.
Say, Ned... ?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
We done that stuff.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Just like that?
I don't get it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
They just said they wanted time.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You heard right.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
County. I was in for fraud.
What fence? Who?
Tough break.
Ready?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
You got him wrong.
Kobayashi.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I don't.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
You're not safe on your own.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
I'm fine.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
You thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
... he wants to testify ...?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
We went to Code Blue...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I am seventy-four years old.
Dr. Thompson...?
That's what I'd planned to...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
Right.  Who called?
I understand.
You know what happened.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Kathy Price.
D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Is this a bad time.
You're going to stay here...?
Not if you don't grow up...
You, you don't under...
Hi, Mickey ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
No.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
The 'History'...?
What?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Kathy Price...
What did she say?
A single hour.
Yeah.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Yes.
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Ernie's.
Did she hurt herself?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Your name. And --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
But you haven't lived here long.
Why?
Because I remind you of her?
An hour?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
Why?!
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
Ah, no!
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Why?
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I don't know... Switzerland?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
No birds live here.
Yes...
Take me away from here?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What do you remember?
There's a name on the gravestone.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No... we're together...
Where?
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
That's following a train of thought.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
How?
Johnny!
Who?
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Around.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Yes! That's it!
Can we have it by tonight?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What are you doing?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Stop it!
Just stop.
What about the blood?
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
What?
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
Adam! Calm down.
There is no candy!
We'll be ready Adam.
Real times.
What.
Have you thought about what I said?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Where is she?
I got her arm.
You said that Boyd.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Boyd...What have we done?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What's your point?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What does that mean?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
That's right.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
The hell you didn't!
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
Caterer?
I think so.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
We've got problems here.
Of course.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
The prostitute.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
What?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
No...
Everything okay?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
That's just insecurity.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Go for it.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
There.
...embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
We will.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
You believe me, don't you?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
And in the vegetable plot?
My God, what have you done to him!
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Do they worry you that much, then?
And ...your friend?
Are your parents alive?
Why not?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
How did you see me?
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Why would they be going there?
He was a computer program for crissake.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Their weapons missing?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
I wonder how that...
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
You all right?
What happened when he was 17?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
You okay?
Lindenmeyer?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
...this is a snappy song....
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What are you talking about?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
...the... 
...you want us to go to War...
<u>Who</u>?
Why?
Precisely.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...uh huh...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Give'em another pill...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
Oh, MiGod.
Quite touching.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Who're you working for?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Why do they go to War?
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Dartmouth
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
"The Country Is At War." 
"Freedom."
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
I think it's fine?
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
An anti-psychotic...

I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.

Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
What're you doing?
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
All part of the Service we Render.
Jim Belushi...?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
The hats.
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Hey the door was open.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Whatever night you like.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your words, not mine...
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Oh yes, I remember you.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
...isn't it perfect!
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
With Mark?
He did?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
But?
What's that?
Thank you Jenkins
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Safety in numbers man.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
No, he wouldn't.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
You think that'll help?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Do you?
No.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Yes?
Um...
She isn't here.
I don't know.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
...just so she could cut them off.
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Know what I think?
What?
...no...no...no...
The planchette?
I think so
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
I'm a terrible friend.
I think three...
Claire?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Maybe we should just...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Hi.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
What?  No.  No.
Sorry.  You understand.
What?
When you do this, I swear...
...like it never even happened...
You're not at the center.
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
We had a seance.
But then you've been so much better...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
What?
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It's Madison Fra--
I never asked you to quit!
Stop...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Huh.
I know.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
Mmmuh...
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Two what...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
My...mother...?
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I don't want the -
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
It wes a dream...!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Lasher - bring us through!
FAST.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
It is from love.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Just one.  The bar's closed.
What else did you see- Michael...?
And whose houses do you design...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Seems more like a year than a month.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
When aid you get home last night...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
Papers...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
What?
What is it?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Well, what do you think?
What?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
That's good
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Get them together.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
You go first.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
You have changed since second grade.
I mean, what do you think?
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I-I don't have the keys.
The one with the horses.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
You mean they knew who I was?
My legacy.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I see.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I'm very aural.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Well? Surprised?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
I do?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
My parents? What do you mean?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Talk to me Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How you doing, Artie?
Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
So you were alone.
What was that?
Why?
I want a full-scale investigation.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Just tell us what happened.
She bit you?
What did you do then?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
That's cop bullshit.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Aha!
Limestone quarry?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Almost?
Now, what was that?
At least I tried something.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Willard...
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
You bring the best out in a man.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Nicely said, sir.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
He had a pressing engagement.
Who was this partner of his?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
They're coming.
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are very important, Willow.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Why did you say that?
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
You a woodcutter?
You hear trouble.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
You?
Want me to carry Elora?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Dada, what's a daikini?
Kill him!
No!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
She needs to be changed.
Who is he?
She's hungry.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
I'm getting her out of there!
I've seen pictures.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
Are they going to kill you?
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
What was that?
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
How long have I been here?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
You know carpentry?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I know.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
You hear me?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
No, Rachel...
No, you listen. Get out!
Momma... are they angry with us.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
...resourceful!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Who are you?
Run, Toto, run!
Toto's my dog.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
...Toto, too?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, come on.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
They're coming back!
...yes.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh --
Real courage. That's what we want.
Dorothy next!
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
Oh, you did it yourself!
That's right.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
We do.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh - look out.
...to Dorothy!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
But I still want one.
What happened to Len Tashka?
So who are you?
Whos she?
What is it?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Is there another way?
But what if...
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
The name?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Yes.
Who is he?
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
Then take me with you.
Vodka martini.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
A rope!
And the payoff on the tables?
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
He was a...good lover?
Its heading for the oil terminal.
The bearer of bad news.
Jon, no -- I can't --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
What was he doing?
Coward.  Giving up.
-- What?
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
No comment.
Their real names, please.
Adrian.
He's a little farther gone every time.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Mind your business.
I was invited. What's your story?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Nice hops.
What's this?
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Scott.. I -
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
Are you all right?
Into the Hudson?
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Dr. Grey.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What am I doing here?
Now that's Magneto talking.
How?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Frederick Frankenstein?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Darling!?!
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Why did you do that?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
There.
I thought you wanted to.
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
You can say that again.
Where is he?
Can you play it?
What monster?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
There's only one way.
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Would you like a sandwich?
Inga, wake up!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Look, Doctor!
Yes!
Good night, Doctor.
I see what you mean.
MMMMmmmmm!
Four
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Food!!
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
